  * Default to initramfs-tools as initramfs generator for amd64, hppa, i386,
    alpha and sparc. More archs will be added once klibc matures.

  * Backport alsa patch for opl3 - Fix the unreleased resources.

  * [ia64] Update config for 2.6.15.

  * Make CONFIG_IPW2100 a per-architecture option and deactivate it on all
    architectures but i386. (Closes: #344515)

  [ Sven Luther ]
  * Removed spurious file from powerpc-apus patch. (Closes: #346159)

linux-2.6 (2.6.15-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Sven Luther ]
  * New upstream release.
  * [powerpc] Now use ARCH=powerpc for 64bit powerpc flavours, 32bit still
    stays with ARCH=ppc for now.
  * [powerpc] Readded PReP Motorola PowerStack II Utah IDE interrupt
    (Closes: #345424)
  * [powerpc] Fixed apus patch.
  * Added make-kpkg --arch option support to gencontrol.py.
  * Added debian/bin/kconfig.ml to process config file snipplet, so we can
    preserve the pre 2.6.15 ordering of config file snipplets. Upto 2.6.15
    the kernel Kconfig magic apparently kept the later occuring config options,
    but it seems that this is no more the case. Instead of catting the config
    files together, not use the kconfig.ml script to read in the files from
    more generic to more specific, and keep only the more specific.

  [ Bastian Blank ]
  * [s390] Update configs.

  [ Kyle McMartin ]
  * [hppa] Snag latest hppa.diff from cvs.parisc-linux.org.
  * [hppa] Update configs for 2.6.15.
  * [hppa] Change parisc kernel names to something less ambiguous.

  * [alpha] Removed conflict with initramfs-tools, thanks vorlon for finding
    the klibc bug!

  [ Jonas Smedegaard ]
  * Adjust short description of transitional package kernel-image-2.6-
    486 to mention 2.6 (not 2.6.12).
  * Clean duplicate Kconfig options.

  [ Frederik Sch端ler ]
  * Add updated version of drivers-scsi-megaraid_splitup.patch.
  * Deactivate CONFIG_IDE_TASK_IOCTL on alpha and ia64 and make it a global
    option.
  * Make CONFIG_VIDEO_SAA7134 a global option.
  * New option CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE set per-arch.
  * Rename i386 368 flavour to 486.
  * Add myself to uploaders.
  * Readdition of qla2xxx drivers, as firmware license has been fixed.
  * Make CONFIG_PACKET, PACKET_MM and UNIX builtin on all architectures:
    statically linked has better performance then modules due to TLB issue.
  * clean up debian-patches dir: remove all obsolete patches:
    - alpha-compile-fix.patch: obsolete
    - amd64-int3-fix.patch: fixed since 2.6.12
    - net-ipconntrack-nat-fix.patch: merged upstream after 2.6.14 release
    - net-nf_queue-oops.patch: merged upstream after 2.6.14 release
    - qla2xxx-removed.patch: obsolete
  * Drop M386 support remains from the i386 386 flavour: built with M486 
    from now on.

  [ Martin Michlmayr ]
  * [arm] Don't define "compiler" since GCC 4.x is the default now anyway.
  * [arm] Add descriptions for "class" and "longclass".
  * [arm] Compile CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SL82C105 support into the kernel on
    Footbridge.
  * [arm] Compile ext3 support into the kernel on Footbridge.
  * [arm] Turn on CONFIG_SERIAL_8250 support on Footbridge.

  [ Jurij Smakov ]
  * [sparc] Correct the patch for the atyfb framebuffer driver
    (sparc64-atyfb-xl-gr.patch) to finally fix the console and X
    image defects on Blade 100/150. The new patch is named
    sparc64-atyfb-xl-gr-final.patch to avoid the confusion.
    Thanks to Luis F. Ortiz for fixing the patch and Luigi Gangitano
    for testing it out.
  * Drop tty-locking-fixes9.patch, which was preventing the oops during
    shutdown on some sparc machines with serial console. Proper fix has
    been incorporated upstream.
  
  [ Simon Horman ]
  * Enable MKISS globally (closes: #340215)
  * Add recommends libc6-i686 to 686 and k7 image packages
    (closes: #278729)
  * Enable OBSOLETE_OSS_USB_DRIVER and USB_AUDIO
    as alsa snd-usb-audio still isn't quite there.
    I expect this to be re-disabled at some stage,
    possibly soon if it proves to be a source of bugs.

    files used to generate the linux-image packages.  Closes: #316809
  * [ia64] Workaround #325070 until upstream works out an acceptable solution.
    This bug breaks module loading on non-SMP ia64 kernels.  The workaround
    is to temporarily use an SMP config for the non-SMP kernels.  (Note that
    John Wright is running benchmarks to determine the overhead of running
    an SMP kernel on UP systems to help decide if this should be a
    permanent change).

  * The Kernel Team offers its condolences to the family of Jens Schmalzing

  * Premiere of the common-source kernel package
    (Jurij Smakov, Andres Salomon)
    - build all architectures out of kernel source package
    - rename source and binary packages
    - create a common config for different architectures, and management
      tools to allow for easier modification of config options
    - drop default configs, autogenerate them instead; requires
      kernel-package >= 9.002.

  * Add 2.6.12.1 (Maximilian Attems)
    - Clean up subthread exec (CAN-2005-1913)
    - ia64 ptrace + sigrestore_context (CAN-2005-1761)

  * Add 2.6.12.2 (Frederik Sch端ler)
    - Fix two socket hashing bugs.
    -  ACPI: Make sure we call acpi_register_gsi() even for default PCI
       interrupt assignment
    - Add "memory" clobbers to the x86 inline asm of strncmp and friends
    - e1000: fix spinlock bug
    - fix remap_pte_range BUG
    - Fix typo in drivers/pci/pci-driver.c

  * Add 2.6.12.3 (Joshua Kwan)
    - Fix semaphore handling in __unregister_chrdev
    - Fix TT mode in UML.
    - Check for a null return in tty_ldisc_ref.
    - v4l: cx88 hue offset fix
    - Fix 8139cp breakage that occurs with tpm driver.
    - Fix the 6pack driver in SMP environments.
    - Switch to spinlocks in the shaper driver.
    - ppc32: stop misusing NTP's time_offset value
    - netfilter: go back to dropping conntrack references manually
    - ACPI: don't accept 0 as a PCI IRQ.

  * Enable CONFIG_SCSI_INITIO. (Maximilian Attems) (closes: #318121)

  * [powerpc] :
    - Added powerpc-mkvmlinuz-support patch which allows, together with
      kernel-package 9.0002 to add mkvmlinuz support to hand built packages.
    - Removed powerpc-ppc64-ibmvscsi.patch, FTBFS, and Christoph doesn't like
      it and thinks it is not needed.
    - Disabled swim3 on powerpc-smp, FTBFS.
    - Disabled software-suspend on powerpc-smp, FTBFS, amd64/i386 only smp code.
    - Rediffed and readded the G4 L2 hardware flush assist patch from Jacob Pan.
    (Sven Luther)
    
  * [sparc]
    - Drop sparc32 flavour for now. sparc32 kernel is currently in the
      category "too buggy for us to support". In spite of numerous efforts
      I still see occasional random filesystem corruptions in my tests.
      That does NOT mean that we are dropping sparc32 support, we will
      work with upstream trying to solve these problems for the next
      kernel release. Those interested in helping/testing are encouraged
      to subscribe to debian-sparc mailing list.
      (Jurij Smakov)

  * [alpha]
    - Renamed resulting binary packages for alpha, kernel-image-x.y.z-generic
      wasn't a generic kernel, it was a generic kernel for alpha machines, so
      we're now using linux-image-x.y.z-alpha-generic (and of course, the same
      change for the smp kernel-image). This change was postponed after the
      sarge release. (closes: #260003)
    (Norbert Tretkowski)

  * [amd64]
    - Now using the default compiler (gcc-4.0), thus we get rid of the 
      annoying MAKEFLAGS="CC=gcc-3.4" make-kpkg... invocation for third-party 
      modules.
      This release lacks 64bit kernels for i386 userland; support will be
      added in a later release as soon as the toolchain has stabilized again.
      (Frederik Sch端ler)
