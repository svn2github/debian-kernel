    flavours if upstream resolved the issue - but that never happened.
    Note that this is a measurable performance penalty on non-SMP systems.

  * [powerpc] Added hotplug support to the mv643xx_eth driver :
      powerpc-mv643xx-hotplug-support.patch
    thanks go to Nicolas Det for providing the patch.
  * [powerpc] Modified a couple of configuration options for the powerpc64
    flavour, fixes and enhances Apple G5 support (Closes: #323724, #328324)
  * [powerpc] Added powerpc-miboot flavour to use exclusively with oldworld
    powermac miboot floppies for debian-installer.
  * [powerpc] Checked upgraded version of the apus patches, separated them in
    a part which is safe to apply, and one which needs checking, and is thus
    not applied yet.

  [ Kyle McMartin ]
  * [hppa] Update hppa.diff to 2.6.13-pa4.
  * [hppa] Add space register fix to pacache.S to hppa.diff.

  * Add a note to README.Debian that explains where users can find the .config
    files used to generate the linux-image packages.  Closes: #316809
  * [ia64] Workaround #325070 until upstream works out an acceptable solution.
    This bug breaks module loading on non-SMP ia64 kernels.  The workaround
    is to temporarily use an SMP config for the non-SMP kernels.  (Note that
    John Wright is running benchmarks to determine the overhead of running
    an SMP kernel on UP systems to help decide if this should be a
    permanent change).
  * [ia64] Update arch/ia64/config for 2.6.13

  * The Kernel Team offers its condolences to the family of Jens Schmalzing
    (jensen@debian), who died Saturday, July 30, 2005 in a tragic accident in

  * Premiere of the common-source kernel package
    (Jurij Smakov, Andres Salomon)
    - build all architectures out of kernel source package
    - rename source and binary packages
    - create a common config for different architectures, and management
      tools to allow for easier modification of config options
    - drop default configs, autogenerate them instead; requires
      kernel-package >= 9.002.

  * Add 2.6.12.1 (Maximilian Attems)
    - Clean up subthread exec (CAN-2005-1913)
    - ia64 ptrace + sigrestore_context (CAN-2005-1761)

  * Add 2.6.12.2 (Frederik Schüler)
    - Fix two socket hashing bugs.
    -  ACPI: Make sure we call acpi_register_gsi() even for default PCI
       interrupt assignment
    - Add "memory" clobbers to the x86 inline asm of strncmp and friends
    - e1000: fix spinlock bug
    - fix remap_pte_range BUG
    - Fix typo in drivers/pci/pci-driver.c

  * Add 2.6.12.3 (Joshua Kwan)
    - Fix semaphore handling in __unregister_chrdev
    - Fix TT mode in UML.
    - Check for a null return in tty_ldisc_ref.
    - v4l: cx88 hue offset fix
    - Fix 8139cp breakage that occurs with tpm driver.
    - Fix the 6pack driver in SMP environments.
    - Switch to spinlocks in the shaper driver.
    - ppc32: stop misusing NTP's time_offset value
    - netfilter: go back to dropping conntrack references manually
    - ACPI: don't accept 0 as a PCI IRQ.

  * Enable CONFIG_SCSI_INITIO. (Maximilian Attems) (closes: #318121)

  * [powerpc] :
    - Added powerpc-mkvmlinuz-support patch which allows, together with
      kernel-package 9.0002 to add mkvmlinuz support to hand built packages.
    - Removed powerpc-ppc64-ibmvscsi.patch, FTBFS, and Christoph doesn't like
      it and thinks it is not needed.
    - Disabled swim3 on powerpc-smp, FTBFS.
    - Disabled software-suspend on powerpc-smp, FTBFS, amd64/i386 only smp code.
    - Rediffed and readded the G4 L2 hardware flush assist patch from Jacob Pan.
    (Sven Luther)
    
  * [sparc]
    - Drop sparc32 flavour for now. sparc32 kernel is currently in the
      category "too buggy for us to support". In spite of numerous efforts
      I still see occasional random filesystem corruptions in my tests.
      That does NOT mean that we are dropping sparc32 support, we will
      work with upstream trying to solve these problems for the next
      kernel release. Those interested in helping/testing are encouraged
      to subscribe to debian-sparc mailing list.
      (Jurij Smakov)

  * [alpha]
    - Renamed resulting binary packages for alpha, kernel-image-x.y.z-generic
      wasn't a generic kernel, it was a generic kernel for alpha machines, so
      we're now using linux-image-x.y.z-alpha-generic (and of course, the same
      change for the smp kernel-image). This change was postponed after the
      sarge release. (closes: #260003)
    (Norbert Tretkowski)

  * [amd64]
    - Now using the default compiler (gcc-4.0), thus we get rid of the 
      annoying MAKEFLAGS="CC=gcc-3.4" make-kpkg... invocation for third-party 
      modules.
      This release lacks 64bit kernels for i386 userland; support will be
      added in a later release as soon as the toolchain has stabilized again.
      (Frederik Schüler)
