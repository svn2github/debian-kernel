Description: Linux kernel source for version @version@ with Debian patches
 This package provides source code for the Linux kernel version @version@.
 This source closely tracks official Linux kernel releases.  Debian's
 modifications to that source consist of security fixes, bug fixes, and
 features that have already been (or are believed to be) accepted by the
 upstream maintainers.
 .
 If you wish to use this package to create a custom Linux kernel, then
 it is suggested that you investigate the package kernel-package,
 which has been designed to ease the task of creating kernel image
 packages.

Description: Linux kernel specific documentation for version @version@
 This package provides the various README files and HTML documentation for
 the Linux kernel version @version@.  Plenty of information, including the
 descriptions of various kernel subsystems, filesystems, driver-specific
 notes and the like.  Consult the file

Description: Linux kernel API manual pages for version @version@
 This package provides the Kernel Hacker's Guide in the form of
 manual pages, describing the kernel API functions.  They
 are installed into section 9 of the manual.
 .
 As the files containing manual pages for different kernel versions
 are installed in the same location, only one linux-manual package
 may be installed at a time.  The linux-doc package containing the
 documentation in other formats is free from such restriction.
