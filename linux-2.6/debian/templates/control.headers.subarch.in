Package: linux-headers-@upstreamversion@@abiname@@localversion_headers@
Section: devel
Priority: optional
Provides: linux-headers, linux-headers-@major@
Description: Common header files for Linux @upstreamversion@
 This package provides the (sub)architecture-specific common kernel header files
 for Linux kernel version @upstreamversion@, generally used for building out-of-tree
 kernel modules. To obtain a complete set of headers you also need to install
 the linux-headers-@upstreamversion@@abiname@-(flavour) package, matching the
 flavour of the kernel you intend the build for. To obtain such a set for the
 currently running kernel it is sufficient to run a command
 .
 apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
 .
 and it will be unpacked in /usr/src/linux-headers-@upstreamversion@@abiname@-(flavour).
