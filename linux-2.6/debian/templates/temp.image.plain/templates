Template: =ST-image-=V/postinst/depmod-error-initrd-=V
Type: boolean
Default: false
Description: Abort installation after depmod error?
 The 'depmod' command exited with the exit code ${exit_value}
 (${SIGNAL}${CORE}).
 .
 Since this image uses initrd, the ${modules_base}/=V/modules.dep file
 will not be deleted, even though it may be invalid.
 .
 You should abort the installation and fix the
 errors in depmod, or regenerate the initrd image with a known good
 modules.dep file. If you don't abort the installation, there is
 a danger that the system will fail to boot.

Template: shared/kernel-image/really-run-bootloader
Type: boolean
Default: true
Description: Run the default boot loader?
 The default boot loader for this architecture is $loader, which is
 present.
 .
 However, there is no explicit request to run that boot loader in
 /etc/kernel-img.conf while GRUB seems to be installed with
 a postinst hook set.
 .
 It thus seems that this system is using GRUB as
 boot loader instead of $loader.
 .
 Please choose which should run: the default boot loader now, or the
 GRUB update later.

Template: =ST-image-=V/postinst/bootloader-test-error-=V
Type: note
Description: Error running the boot loader in test mode
 An error occurred while running the ${loader} boot loader in test mode.
 .
 A log is available in ${temp_file_name}. Please edit /etc/${loader}.conf
 manually and re-run ${loader} to fix that issue and keep this system
 bootable.

Template: =ST-image-=V/postinst/bootloader-error-=V
Type: note
Description: Error running the boot loader
 An error occurred while running the ${loader} boot loader.
 .
 A log is available in ${temp_file_name}. Please edit /etc/${loader}.conf
 manually and re-run ${loader} to fix that issue and keep this system
 bootable.

Template: =ST-image-=V/prerm/removing-running-kernel-=V
Type: boolean
Default: true
Description: Abort kernel removal?
 You are running a kernel (version ${running}) and attempting to remove
 the same version.
 .
 This can make the system unbootable as it will remove
 /boot/vmlinuz-${running} and all modules under the directory
 /lib/modules/${running}. This can only be fixed with a copy of the
 kernel image and the corresponding modules.
 .
 It is highly recommended to abort the kernel removal unless you are
 prepared to fix the system after removal.

Template: =ST-image-=V/prerm/would-invalidate-boot-loader-=V
Type: boolean
Default: true
Description: Abort kernel removal?
 This system uses a valid /etc/${loader}.conf file that mentions
 ${kimage}-=V. Removing =ST-image-=V will invalidate
 that file.
 .
 You will need to edit /etc/${loader}.conf or re-target
 symbolic links mentioned there (typically, /vmlinuz and /vmlinuz.old)
 to not refer to ${kimage}-=V. Then, you will have to re-run ${loader}.
 .
 It is highly recommended to abort the kernel removal unless you are
 prepared to fix the system after removal.

Template: =ST-image-=V/postinst/missing-firmware-=V
Type: note
Description: Required firmware files may be missing
 This system is currently running Linux ${runningversion} and you are
 installing Linux ${version}.  In the new version some of the drivers
 used on this system may require additional firmware files:
 .
 ${missing}
 .
 Most firmware files are not included in the Debian system because
 no source code is available for them.  You may need to reconfigure
 the package manager to include the non-free section of the Debian
 archive before you can install these firmware files.
