Comment:
 The 'perf' tool is dynamically linked with the Python interpreter,
 which is itself dynamically linked with OpenSSL, which is not
 GPL-compatible.  However, since perf itself does not link with or use
 OpenSSL, we believe that this indirect linking does not require
 additional permissions beyond the GPL.
