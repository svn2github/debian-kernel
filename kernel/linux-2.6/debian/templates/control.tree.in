Description: Linux kernel source tree for building Debian kernel images
 This meta package is used as a build dependency of Debian
 linux-image packages to prevent a version discrepancy between
 the linux-image and corresponding linux-sources packages in the
 fast-moving unstable archive. The package's dependency relations
 are structured so that a linux-image package's build
 dependencies can always be satisfied, even if the linux-source
 package that had been used to compile the image has been
 superseeded by a newer Debian revision since the last build.
 .
 The package provides a list of virtual packages, corresponding to
 Debian revisions of a linux-source package. The Debian
 linux-patch contains the information needed to roll back the
 current linux-source to any of the revisions identified by the
 provided virtual packages. Therefore, the linux-tree package
 ensures the availability of the Linux kernel source tree corresponding
 to each of the virtual packages listed.
 .
 The package serves no purpose outside of the Debian build and
 archive infrastructure.
