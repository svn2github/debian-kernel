Description: Linux kernel source for version 2.6.11 with Debian patches
 This package provides the source code for the Linux kernel version 2.6.11.
 .
 You may configure the kernel to your setup by typing "make config"
 and following instructions, but you could get ncursesX.X-dev and try
 "make menuconfig" for a jazzier, and easier to use interface. There 
 are options to use QT or GNOME based configuration interfaces, but they
 need additional packages to be installed. Also, please read the detailed 
 documentation in the file
 /usr/share/doc/kernel-source-2.6.11/README.headers.gz.
 .
 If you wish to use this package to create a custom Linux kernel, then
 it is suggested that you investigate the package kernel-package,
 which has been designed to ease the task of creating kernel image
 packages.

Description: Linux kernel specific documentation for version 2.6.11
 This package provides the various readme's in the 2.6.11 kernel
 Documentation/ subdirectory: these typically contain kernel-specific
 installation notes for some drivers for example. See
 /usr/share/doc/kernel-doc-X.X.XX/Documentation/00-INDEX for a list of what
 is contained in each file.  Please read the Changes file, as it
 contains information about the problems, which may result by
 upgrading your kernel.

Suggests: kernel-source-2.6.11
Description: Debian patches to Linux 2.6.11
 This package includes the patches used to produce the prepackaged
 kernel-source-2.6.11 package.  Note that these patches are not intended to
 apply against a pristine Linux 2.6.11 kernel but only against
 kernel-source-2.6.11_2.6.11.orig.tar.gz from the Debian archive.

Description: Linux kernel source tree for building Debian kernel images
 This meta package is used as a build dependency of Debian
 kernel-image packages to prevent a version discrepancy between
 the kernel-image and corresponding kernel-sources packages in the
 fast-moving unstable archive. The package's dependency relations
 are structured so that a kernel-image package's build
 dependencies can always be satisfied, even if the kernel-source
 package that had been used to compile the image has been
 superseeded by a newer Debian revision since the last build.
 .
 The package provides a list of virtual packages, corresponding to
 Debian revisions of a kernel-source package. The Debian
 kernel-patch contains the information needed to roll back the
 current kernel-source to any of the revisions identified by the
 provided virtual packages. Therefore, the kernel-tree package
 ensures the availability of the kernel source tree corresponding
 to each of the virtual packages listed.
 .
 The package serves no purpose outside of the Debian build and
 archive infrastructure.
