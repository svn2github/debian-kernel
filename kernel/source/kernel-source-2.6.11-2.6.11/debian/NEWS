kernel-source-2.6.11 (2.6.11-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This release drops the tg3 driver.  Previously, it was included, but
    with (non-free) firmware stripped out.  Instead, from now on, it will
    be in a separate package; kernel-nonfree-source-2.6.11.  This package
    is in non-free, and contains the full tg3 driver (with firmware), as
    well as a number of other drivers that have been removed from Debian's
    kernel-source packages for quite some time.
