kernel-latest-2.6-i386 (100) unstable; urgency=high

  * Release with kernel-image-2.6.8-i386_2.6.8-3 (Andres Salomon).
  * Created this package for meta packages that had
    previously been provided by kernel-image-2.6.XX-i386 (Joshua Kwan)
    - This is to allow kernel-image packages for multiple
      upstream kernel versions to co-exist.
    - Initial version is 100, as previous versions of
      the meta packages are already in the archive.
