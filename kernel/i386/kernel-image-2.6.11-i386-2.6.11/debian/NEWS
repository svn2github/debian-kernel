kernel-image-2.6.11-i386 (2.6.11-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * This release drops the tg3 driver.  Previously, it was included in
    kernel-source-2.6.x, but with (non-free) firmware stripped out.
    As of kernel-source-2.6.11, it is now included in a separate package;
    kernel-nonfree-source-2.6.11.  This package is in non-free, and
    contains the full tg3 driver (with firmware), as well as a number
    of other drivers that have been removed from Debian's kernel-source
    packages for quite some time.  Along with the kernel-source packages,
    kernel-nonfree-modules-2.6.11-1-* contains the binary drivers built
    against kernel-nonfree-source (and is also in non-free).
