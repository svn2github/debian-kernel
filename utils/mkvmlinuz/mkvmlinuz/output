# This is a shell script fragment that is sourced by mkvmlinuz(8) in
# order to determine the output file for the compressed kernel image.
# if the output file is not specified on the command line.  Therefore,
# it should set the shell variable "output" at some point.

# When this fragment is sourced, the following shell variables are set
# and may be used to construct the filename:
#
# arch    - PowerPC sub-architecture
# kernel  - path to kernel image file in uncompressed ELF format
# sysmap  - path to System.map file
# initrd  - path to ramdisk (initrd) image file
# objdir  - path to directory with additional object files
# release - kernel release number

# Example:
output=/boot/vmlinuz-$release

# Simple example:
#output=/vmlinuz

# Sophisticated example:
#if test -z "$initrd"; then
#output=/boot/vmlinuz-$release.$arch
#else
#output=/boot/vmlinuz-initrd-$release.$arch
#fi

# Let's define also the name of the symlink here.
# An empty $linkname means no symlink created.
linkname=/boot/vmlinuz
