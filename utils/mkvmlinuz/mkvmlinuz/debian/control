Description: create a kernel to boot a PowerPC machine from Open Firmware
 This little program takes a PowerPC Linux kernel as an uncompressed
 ELF image file (usually called vmlinux or such) and adds a boot code
 and possibly a ramdisk to create a compressed kernel image that can
 be booted directly from Open Firmware, thus eliminating the need for
 a second-stage bootloader such as yaboot or quik. This is especially
 useful on PowerPC sub-architectures which do not have a bootloader
 at all, but may also come handy to install kernels, netboot systems,
 and the likes.
