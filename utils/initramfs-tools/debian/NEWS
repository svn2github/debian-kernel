initramfs-tools (0.61) unstable; urgency=low

  * This release moves the initramfs-tools confdir from /etc/mkinitramfs to
    /etc/initramfs-tools. Packages are encouraged to ship files as scripts
    under /usr/share/initramfs-tools.

    Local tests behaved fine, but be warned that this could potentially
    cause boot troubles on upgrade.

initramfs-tools (0.10) breezy; urgency=low

  * This release includes hardware auto detection in the initramfs.
    This means two things in particular that are important:

    1) the resulting initramfs will be huge.  Like 10 megs huge.
       I will shrink it down once it's correct.  If you're on an 
       arch that doesn't like >4mb initramfs', then this won't boot.

    2) Your network drivers are loaded in the initramfs, so hotplug
       won't see a network event, so ifup won't be run.  This will
       be fixed shortly in hotplug.
