initramfs-tools (0.10) breezy; urgency=low

  * This release includes hardware auto detection in the initramfs.
    This means two things in particular that are important:

    1) the resulting initramfs will be huge.  Like 10 megs huge.
       I will shrink it down once it's correct.  If you're on an 
       arch that doesn't like >4mb initramfs', then this won't boot.

    2) Your network drivers are loaded in the initramfs, so hotplug
       won't see a network event, so ifup won't be run.  This will
       be fixed shortly in hotplug.
