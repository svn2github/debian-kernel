.SH NAME
mkinitramfs \- generate an initramfs image

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mkinitramfs
.RB [ \-d 
.IR confdir ] 
.RB [ \-k ] 
.RB [ \-o 
.IR outfile ] 
.RB [ \-r 
.IR root ] 
.RI [ version ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B mkinitramfs 
script generates an initramfs image.  The initramfs is an cpio archive. 
At boot time, the kernel unpacks that archive into ram disk, mounts and 
uses it as initial root file system. All finding of the root device 
happens in this early userspace.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB \-d \fI confdir
Set an alternate configuration directory.

.TP
\fB \-k
Keep the temporary directory used to make the image.

.TP
\fB \-o \fI outfile
Write the image to 
.IR outfile .

.TP
\fB \-r \fI root
Override the 
.B ROOT 
setting in 
.IR mkinitramfs.conf .

.SH FILES
.TP
.I /etc/mkinitramfs/initramfs.conf
The default configuration file for the script. See
.BR initramfs.conf (5)
for a description of the available configuration parameter.

.TP
.I /etc/mkinitramfs/modules
Specified modules will be put in the generated image and loaded when the system boots. The format - one per line - is identical to that of
.I /etc/modules,
which is described in
.BR modules (5).

.TP
.I /etc/mkinitramfs/DSDT.aml
If this file exists, it will be appended to the initramfs in a way that causes
it to be loaded by ACPI.
