.TH INITRAMFS.CONF 5  "$Date: 2005/12/06 $" "" "initramfs.conf manual"

.SH NAME
initramfs.conf \- configuration file for mkinitramfs

.SH DESCRIPTION
The behaviour of
.B mkinitramfs 
can be modified by its configuration file.

Each line in the file can be a configuration variable, a blank line,
or a comment. The value of an variable is assigned by an statement
of the form: \fIname\fP=[\fIvalue\fP]

Configuration options can be broken out into configuration snippets and
placed in individual files in the /etc/mkinitramfs/conf.d directory.  Files
in this directory are always read \fBafter\fP the main configuration file,
so you can override the settings in the main config file without editing it
directly.

.SH GENERAL VARIABLES
.TP
\fB MODULES
Specifies the modules for the initramfs image.
The default setting is \fImost\fP.

\fImost\fP adds all the framebuffer, acpi, file system, ide, sata, scsi and usb drivers.

\fIdep\fP tries to guess which modules are necessary for the running box.

\fInetboot\fP adds the base modules, network modules, but skips block devices.

\fIlist\fP includes only modules from the additional modules list.

.TP
\fB RESUME
Optional setting of the swap partition to resume from.
The resume= passed on the command line of your boot loader 
will override this setting.    By default, this is set in
/etc/mkinitramfs/conf.d/resume.

.SH NFS VARIABLES
.TP
\fB BOOT
Allows to use an nfs drive as the root of the drive. 
The default is to boot of an \fIlocal\fP media (harddrive, USB stick).
Set to \fInfs\fP for an NFS root share.

.TP
\fB DEVICE
Specifies the network interface, like eth0.

.TP
\fB NFSROOT
Defaults to \fIauto\fP in order to pick up value from DHCP server.
Otherwise you need to specify \fIHOST:MOUNT\fP.
