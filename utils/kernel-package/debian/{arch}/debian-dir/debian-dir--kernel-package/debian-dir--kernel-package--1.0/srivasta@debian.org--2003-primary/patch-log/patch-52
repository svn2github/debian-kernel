Summary: Minor Fixes
Keywords: 

"kernel-package: Improvements for kernel_grub_rm.sh script",
thanks to Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña. I created my own patch,
rather than using the one in the report, but thanks for pointing this
out.                   

"mismatch between lilo.conf and the actual filename
&quot;initrd.old&quot;.", thanks to David Robin. The fix is actually
thanks to Khalid Aziz, who noticed that in one corner case the
symbolic link was moved to the wrong location.   

"bash_completion.d/make-kpkg prints grep error messages if
.config doesn't exist", thanks to Josh Triplett
