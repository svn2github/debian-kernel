Summary: A bug fix release
Keywords: 

Strange set of error messages about build link on fresh
install, quoth Joey Hess. This was related to the postinst trying to
handle the dangling build link. Now actually test to see if the link
was present, and is a bit more chatty.             (Closes: #221286).

Bug fix: "kernel-package: Inconsistent default kernel-image package
revision", thanks to Roland Stigge.  Made it 10.0.Custome all over.
                                                    (Closes: #221916).
Bug fix: "tries to access lib/modules/<version>/build even when
it doesn't exist", thanks to Peter Palfrader.         (Closes: #222239).
