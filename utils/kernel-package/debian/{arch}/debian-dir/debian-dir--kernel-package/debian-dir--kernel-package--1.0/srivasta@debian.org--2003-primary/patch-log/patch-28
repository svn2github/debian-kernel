Summary: Important bug fix release
Keywords: 

The important bug fixed here (and thanks go to joshk for that) is that
when we clean the sources, and patches are unapplied, the
unapplication dhould be done in reverse order. We do take care of that
for patches specified on the command line, but if the user had wanted
all installed patches applied, there was a glitch. This bug crept in
in the last upload.

The other major fix is that when we run depmod it shall no longer go
into an infinite loop while trying to chase down the build and source
symbolic links.

There are also a couple of small fixes in this release;  including
passing KERNEL_ARCH to third party module builds, and a man page
typo. 

A new feature has been introduced in this release, with many thanks to
Ralph Pa√ügang <ralph@debianbase.de>, qho implemented the uml package
feature.
