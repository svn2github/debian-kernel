Summary: Fixed bashims in update-grub, and an error report for mkinitrd
Keywords: 

Went along with the removal of bashism from maintainer scripts. Also,
we were aborting if we could not find mkinitrd in preinst, however, if
initrd-tools are being installed at the same time, mkinitrd may not be
preset when we run the preinst. Therefore, turn the error into an
informational message.
