Summary: New bug fix version
Keywords: 

 Bug fix: "when generating buildinfo, should also consider [h]eld
 packages", thanks to Joshua Kwan. I sync-tree's with josjk's version,
 but did not actually use that code, since there have been changes made
 in the rules file since, and there are also some permission changes I
 did not want to revert. This shall allow him to star-merge back to get
 my fixes.

 Bug fix: "kernel-package: improved CONCURRENCY_LEVEL docs", thanks to
 Bastian Kleineidam 

 Bug fix: "kernel-package: Clarify documentation on kernel patches",
 thanks to Ross Boylan. Added a note in the make-kpkg man page.
