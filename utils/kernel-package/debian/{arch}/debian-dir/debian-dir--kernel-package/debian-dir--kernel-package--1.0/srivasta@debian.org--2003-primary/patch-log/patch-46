Summary: Updated mips rules, fixed problems with nuking scripts Makefiles
Keywords: 

The was an unfortunate confluence of moving and touching the scripts
Makefile, and make clean: the dummy, empty Makefile was removed, and thus
never made it into the source package. Fixed it to echo a no-op comment
into the dummy Makefile.
