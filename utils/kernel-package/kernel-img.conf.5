.SH NAME
kernel\-img.conf \- site wide configuration file for kernel image packages
.SH SYNOPSIS
.I /etc/kernel\-img.conf
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The file 
.I /etc/kernel\-img.conf
is a simple file looked at by the kernel image post installation
process to allow local options for handling some aspects of the
installation, overriding the defaults built into the image itself. 
.PP
The format of the file is a simple 
.B VAR = VALUE 
pair. Boolean values may be specified as
.I Yes, True, 1,
and
.I No, False, 0,
and are case insensitive. 
This file is automatically created by the installation script if
it does not exist, and neither does the symbolic link
.I /vmlinuz.
The script asks the user whether the symbolic link should be created, 
and stashes the answer into 
.I /etc/kernel\-img.conf
.PP
At the moment, the user modifiable variables supported are:
.TP
.B link_in_boot 
Set to Yes if you want the symbolic link to the kernel image, namely, 
.I vmlinuz 
in 
.I /boot 
rather than the default 
.I /.  
The old, and very confusing, name image_in_boot is deprecated, since
it is the symbolic link that is usually being relocated. 
Defaults to No.
.TP
.B do_symlinks
By default, the kernel image post installation script shall create or
update the 
.I /vmlinuz
and 
.I /vmlinuz.old 
symbolic links. This is true if a 
.I /vmlinuz
link already exists, however, in absence of
.I /vmlinuz,
the script looks to see if this configuration file exists. If it does
not, the configuration script asks the user whether to create the
symbolic link, and stashes the answer in a newly created
.I /etc/kernel\-img.conf.
If the configuration file already exists, and 
if this option is set to No, no symbolic link is ever created. This
for people who have other means of booting their machines, and do not
like the symbolic links cluttering up their / directory.  Defaults to Yes. 
.TP
.B minimal_swap
By default, if the /vmlinuz symbolic link does not point to an image
which is the same as the image being installed, the postinst moves
/vmlinuz to /vmlinuz.old, and creates a symbolic link to the kernel
image in /vmlinuz (the exception is to prevent both /vmlinuz and
/vmlinuz.old from pointing to the current kernel image -- potentially
disastrous if the current image is defective or lacking in any
way). However, if this option is enabled, no action is taken if
/vmlinuz.old points to the currently installed image (by default, the
symbolic links are swapped).  Defaults to no.
.TP
.B no_symlinks
Whether to use symlinks to the 
.I image
file. 
Mutually exclusive to 
.I reverse_symlinks. 
Can be used with
.I link_in_boot (image_in_boot).
If set to Yes, the real image is placed in vmlinuz (instead of
/boot/vmlinuz\-X.X.XX). If you use link_in_boot in conjunction with
this, /boot/vmlinuz\-X.X.XX is moved to /boot/vmlinuz.  The old vmlinuz
is moved to vmlinuz.old unconditionally. (Normally, that is only done
if the version of the new image differs from the old one). This
restricts you to two images, unless you take additional action and
save copies of older images. This is for people who have
.I /boot 
on a system that does not use symbolic links (and say, they use
loadlin as a bootloader). This is a Hack.
Defaults to No. 
.TP
.B reverse_symlinks
Whether to use reverse symlinks (that is, the real file is the one
without the version number, and the number version is the link) to the 
.I image
file. 
Mutually exclusive to 
.I no_symlinks.
Can be used with
.I link_in_boot (image_in_boot).
Just like 
.I no_symlinks, 
except that the
/boot/vmlinuz\-X.XX is a symbolic link to the real new
image, vmlinuz. This, too, restricts you to just two
images unless further action is taken. The older
symlinks are left dangling. This is for people with
.I /boot 
on umsdos, and who can't see the link in dos, but
do want to know the image version when in Linux. 
This is a Hack.
Defaults to  No.
.TP
.B image_dest 
If you want the symbolic link (or image, if 
.B move_image 
is set) to be stored elsewhere than
.I /
set this variable to the dir where you want the symbolic link.
Please note that this is not a boolean variable.  This may be of
help to
.B loadlin
users, who may set both this and
.B move_image 
Defaults to 
.I /.
This can be used in conjunction with all above options except
.B link_in_boot (image_in_boot),
which would not make sense. (If both 
.B image_dest 
and 
.B link_in_boot (image_in_boot)
are set, 
.B link_in_boot (image_in_boot)
overrides)
.TP
.B postinst_hook 
Set this variable to a script to be executed during installation after
all the symbolic 
links are created, but before running the bootloader or offering to
create a floppy. This script shall be called with two arguments,
the first being the
.I version
of the kernel image, and the second argument being the
.I location
of the kernel image itself. Errors in the script shall produce a
warning message, but shall be otherwise ignored. An example script for
grub users is present in /usr/share/doc/kernel\-package/ directory.
.TP
.B postrm_hook 
Set this variable to a script to be executed in the postrm (that is,
after the image has been removed) after all the remove actions have
been performed. This script shall be called with two arguments,
the first being the
.I version
of the kernel image, and the second argument being the
.I location
of the kernel image itself. Errors in the script shall produce a
warning message, but shall be otherwise ignored.
.TP
.B preinst_hook 
Set this variable to a script to be executed before the package is
unpacked, and can be used to put in additional checks. This script
shall be called with two arguments, the first being the
.I version
of the kernel image, and the second argument being the
.I location
of the kernel image itself. 
.TP
.B prerm_hook 
Set this variable to a script to be executed before the package files
are removed (so any added files may be removed) . This script shall be
called with two arguments, the first being the
.I version
of the kernel image, and the second argument being the
.I location
of the kernel image itself. Errors in the script shall produce a
warning message, but shall be otherwise ignored.
.TP
.B ramdisk
Set this variable to a executable that creates an initial RAM
disk. This only has any effect if installing a kernel-image that uses
an initial RAM disk. The command so pointed must be drop-in compatible
with
.I mkinitrd.
.TP
.B src_postinst_hook 
Unlike the other hook variables, this is meant for a script run during
the post inst of a docs, headers or a source package. Using this hook
for the headers package is now being deprecated, at some point the
headers post install script shall only run the header_postinst_hook.
This script shall be called with two arguments, the first being the
.I name
of the package being installed (could be kernel\-source\-X.X.XX or
kernel\-headers\-X.X.XX), and the second argument being the
.I version
of the package being installed. Errors in the script shall produce a
warning message, but shall be otherwise ignored. 
.TP
.B headers_postinst_hook 
Unlike the other hook variables, this is meant for a script run during
the post inst of a headers package only. This script
shall be called with two arguments, the first being the
.I name
of the package being installed (kernel\-headers\-X.X.XX), and the second argument being the
.I version
of the package being installed. Errors in the script shall produce a
warning message, but shall be otherwise ignored. 
.TP
.B move_image 
Instead of creating symbolic links to (or, if 
.B reverse_symlinks 
is set, from)
.B image_dest,
the image is moved from its location in
.I /boot
into 
.B image_dest.
If 
.B reverse_symlinks 
is set, 
.I /boot
shall contain a symbolic link to the actual image.
This option can be useful to people using loadlin, who may need the
image to be moved to a different, dos partition.
This variable is unset by default.
.TP
.B clobber_modules
If set, the preinst shall silently try to move /lib/modules/version
out of the way if it is the same version as the image being
installed. Use at your own risk.
This variable is unset by default.
.TP
.B do_boot_enable
If set to NO, this short circuits all attempts to create
boot floppies, run lilo, etc. This has the additional
side effect that the postinst is silent. Setting both
.B do_bootfloppy
and 
.B do_bootloader
to NO implies setting
.B do_boot_enable 
to NO. Defaults to Yes.
.TP
.B do_bootfloppy
If set to NO, this prevents the postinst from asking
questions about creating a boot floppy. and no boot
floppy is created. The bootloader shall still be run.
This may cut down on the interaction the postinst has.
(It still prompts before formatting 
.I /dev/fd0) 
Defaults
to Yes.
.TP
.B do_bootloader
If set to NO, this prevents the postinst from running the boot
loader. The user may still be asked to create a floppy, unless 
.B do_bootfloppy
is also set to NO. Defaults to Yes.
.TP
.B relative_links
If set to yes, the kernel image postinst script shall go to extra
ordinary lengths to ensure that the symbolic links are
relative. Normally, the symbolic links are relative when it is easily
determinable that relative links shall work. Defaults to No.
.TP
.B do_initrd
Set to YES to prevent the
.I kernel\-image
post installation script from issuing a warning when installing an
initrd kernel. This assumes you have correctly set up your boot loader
to be able to boot the initrd image. Default: no. This is deprecated
in favour of the more descriptive
.B warn_initrd
option (please note that the sense of the option is inverted).
.TP
.B warn_initrd
Set to NO to prevent the
.I kernel\-image
post installation script from issuing a warning when installing an
initrd kernel. This assumes you have correctly set up your boot loader
to be able to boot the initrd image. This is now preferred to 
.B do_initrd,
since 
.I warnings
are what are prevented. Default: YES
.TP
.B use_hard_links
This option has been put in for the people who can't handle symbolic
links (a boot loader that does not handle symbolic links, for
example). If set to YES, this shall cause the kernel image  postinst
to use hard link instead of symbolic links for the automatically
handled /vmlinuz and /vmlinuz.old.  I have tried to make it compatible
with 
.B move_image
and
.B reverse_symlinks
Caveat: It is up to the end user to ensure that the 
.B image_dest
directory and the location of the image (nominally /boot) live on the
same file system (since one can't make hard links across file
systems). 
.B You have been warned.
.TP
.B relink_build_link
This option manipulates the build link created by recent kernels. If
the link is a dangling link, and if a the corresponding kernel\-headers
appear to have been installed on the system, a new symlink shall be
created to point to them. The default is to relink the build link
(YES).
.TP
.B force_build_link
This option manipulates the build link created by recent kernels. If
the link is a dangling link, a new symlink shall be created to point
to /usr/src/kernel\-headers\-X.Y.ZZ, whether they have been installed or
not. The default is unset, we don't create potentially dangling
symlinks by default.
.TP
.B relink_src_link
This option manipulates the source link created by recent kernels. If
the link is a dangling link it is deleted at install time. The default
is to relink (delete) the source link (YES).
.TP
.B mkimage
This should be a command that produces an initrd image given a
directory. It is passed to the 
.I mkinitrd
program's 
.I \-m
option. For example, it can be
  mkimage="genromfs -d %s -f %s"
or
  mkimage="mkcramfs %s %s"
.TP
.B silent_modules
This option has been put in for the people who are vastly irritated on
being warned about preexisting modules directory 
.I /lib/modules/$version
That directory may belong to an old or defunct 
.I kernel\-image\-$version 
package, in which case problems may arise with leftover modules in that
dir tree, or the directory may legitimately exist due to a independent
modules package being installed for this kernel version that has
already been unpacked.  In this latter case the existence of the
directory is benign.  If you set this variable, you shall no longer be
given a chance to abort if a preexisting modules directory 
.I /lib/modules/$version
is detected.  This is unset be default.
.TP
.B silent_loader
If set, this option shall cause the question asked before running the
boot loader in the installation process to be skipped. Whether or not
the boot loader is run is unaffected by this option ( see
.B do_bootloader
to see how to control whether the boot loader is run or not, and the
absence of the configuration file will also make the install process
voluble and interactive).
.TP 
.B ignore_depmod_err
If set, does not prompt to continue after a depmod problem in the
postinstall script. This facilitates automated installs, though it may
mask a problem with the kernel image. A diagnostic is still issued.
