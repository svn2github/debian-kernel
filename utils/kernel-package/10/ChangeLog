	* make-kpkg.8:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-55

		  make-kpkg creates one for you, and runs make oldconfig.

2005-11-07  Manoj Srivastava  <srivasta@debian.org>

	* README (DATE):
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-64
		  Changed the default version of the packages generated 

	* kernel-pkg.conf (priority):
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-64
		  reset the commented out value to show it can incorporate
		  the version of the kernel being built.  The packages
		  generated are not debian native, and should not have a
		  native numbering scheme. 

2005-11-06  Manoj Srivastava  <srivasta@debian.org>

	* Makefile (check):
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-57
		  Added kernel/pkg/headers/create_link to the files tested
		  when doing a make check. 

2005-11-03  Manoj Srivastava  <srivasta@debian.org>

	* kernel-pkg.conf.5 (maintainer):
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-55
		  The do_clean config variable now optionally causes the
	          source directory to be cleaned up after a kernel image
	          is build -- earlier, we cleaned unconditionally.

	* kernel-img.conf.5:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-55
		  Get rid of the variables that has the postinst script
		  for kernel images create a boot floppy, and also the do
		  boot enable option, which is now synonymous with the
		  boot loader options. 

2005-11-02  Manoj Srivastava  <srivasta@debian.org>

	* make-kpkg (main):
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-53
		  Create an alternate command (including an alternate
		  rules file, the minimal one) in case ./debian has not
		  yet been populated. This means that the default rules
		  file for the main command  is always fixed to be
		  ./debian/rules, and we now just check
		  /usr/share/kernel-package/rules for existence. If
		  ./debian is not populated, the alternate command is
		  built up, according to the  following logic: if the
		  target is clean or debian, we just set the alternate
		  command accordingly. If the target is anything else,
		  then the alternate command is set to be debian -- so
		  that ./debian is properly populated first. So, id
		  ./debian is not populated, and the command is  clean or
		  debian, just the alternate command is run. If the target
		  was  anything else (with an un-populated ./debian), then
		  first the alternate  command is run to populate
		  ./debian, then the normal command is run using the newly
		  created ./debian. 

2005-11-01  Manoj Srivastava  <srivasta@debian.org>

	* Makefile (DOCFILES):
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-53
		  Removed package specific readme files (which really do
		  not belong in kernel-package documentation, and added
		  new docs that had been neglected. 

2005-10-28  Manoj Srivastava  <srivasta@debian.org>

	* Makefile (install):
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-48
		  Adjust for the reorganization of the files, since the
		  source files are no longer in their previous
		  locations. Keep the destination mostly the same. 

2005-10-25  Manoj Srivastava  <srivasta@debian.org>

	* make-kpkg.8:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-45
		  typo fix.

	* kernel-pkg.conf.5:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-44
		  Document the fact that one can provide the default
		  values for the list by setting INITRD_CMD, but this list
		  can be overridden by the one in
		  kernel-img.conf.5. However, the defaults are set to a
		  subset of "mkinitrd mkinitrd.yaird mkinitramfs", the
		  subset being decided based on the version of the kernel
		  being built, so one should refrain from setting this
		  manually -- unless one knows what one is doing. 

	* kernel-img.conf.5:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-44
		  Document the fact that the ramdisk variable can now be a
		  space separated list of init ram disk creation commands,
		  which  need to also support the --supported-host-version
		  and  --supported-target-version options, just like
		  mkinitrd does.  This is the list tried at installation
		  time. 

2005-08-31  Manoj Srivastava  <srivasta@debian.org>

	* _make-kpkg:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-36
		  Added new option stem to the completion 
		  Pared down the config options
		  Completed the list of available targets

2005-08-15  Manoj Srivastava  <srivasta@debian.org>

	* make-kpkg.8:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-34
		  Document the new target kernel_manual 
		  Fixed a misplaced .TP symbol

	* make-kpkg:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-34
		  Added kernel_manual as a known target for the command. 

2005-08-07  Manoj Srivastava  <srivasta@debian.org>

	* make-kpkg.8:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-32
		  change ro -> to

	* kernel-pkg.conf.5:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-32
		  A large set6 of typographical corrections.

	* kernel-img.conf.5 (Caveat):
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-30
		  Fix typo in man page relink_source_link -> relink_src_link 
		  Various other typo fixes as well.

2005-07-19  Manoj Srivastava  <srivasta@debian.org>

	* make-kpkg.8:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-22
		  Document new configure targets.

	* make-kpkg (main):
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-22
		  Permit the new configuration targets now available in
		  the kernel Makefile. The new config targets that have
		  now been added to the kernel arerandconfig,
		  defconfig, allmodconfig, allyesconfig,
		  allnoconfig. 
	  (main):
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-22
		  Since we modified the regular expression for the
		  config target, we need to adjust the check as well.

2005-07-15  Manoj Srivastava  <srivasta@debian.org>

	* make-kpkg.8:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-19
		  In preparation for non-linux kernels in the
		  distribution, kernel-package has had a switch to allow
		  the packages to be named linux-* instead of
		  kernel-*. However, this has remained largely
		  undocumented. Added documentation for the --stem option
		  for make-kpkg. 

2005-06-13  Manoj Srivastava  <srivasta@debian.org>

	* kernel-img.conf.5:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-13
		  Added documentation for the ramdisk variable.

2005-06-08  Manoj Srivastava  <srivasta@debian.org>

	* make-kpkg.8:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-5
		  removed the mention of the cramfs patch, and also
		  removed references to INITRD_OK, which is now obsolete 

	* make-kpkg:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-5
		  removed the mention of the cramfs patch, and also
		  removed references to INITRD_OK, which is now obsolete 
		  (main):
			  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-5
			  Removed the check and the warning when
			  --initrd was being used. Now we just add
			  the INITRD=YES to the command line and
			  go on.  

	* README (so):
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-5
		  Remove cramfs patch warning in a couple of places (we
		  used to tell people to be sure to apply the cramfs patch
		  or tell mkinitrd not to use cramfs, and this is no
		  longer required for modern kernels)
