kernel-package (10.006) experimental; urgency=low

  * Hmm. We need to take special care of the case in which the
    kernel-headers are installed after the kernel-image has been; and the
    build symlink is not setr. In this case, the header postinst now
    correctly installs the build symlink.

kernel-package (10.005) experimental; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: "kernel/image.postinst should mention GRUB", thanks to
    Martin Michlmayr. Well, I don't see why we should mention _any_ boot
    loader at all, so we are no longer biased against grub. (Closes: #336927)
  * Bug fix: "kernel-package: Using dpkg --remove followed by dpkg
    --install does not restore the kernel package", thanks to Daniel
    Jacobowitz. Also: "kernel-package tells me we're being reinstalled AND
    updated". Actually, the installed/updated is just sematics; when you
    reinstall a kernel image you are updating it, and vice versa. The
    actual problem was that while the symbolic links were removed when the
    package was removed, dpkg passed the last-version-configured to the
    postinst, and we took that as evidence that the package had been
    installed before -- which, while true, did not take into account that
    the package was currently uninstalled. The fix is to always see if a
    missing symlink needs to be installed, and not touch existing
    symlinks.                                       (Closes: #336733,  #336517).
  * Added kernel/pkg/headers/create_link as an example. The user can install
    it in the postinst.d directory to set up the /lib/modules/foo/build
    symlink to point to the kernel-headers. This is not needed, since the
    kernel-image postinst already checks in the /usr/src/ directory for an
    installed kernel headers package.
  * Convert the image prerm scripts to debconf as well, the questions are
    asked if we try to remove the running kernel image, or if we are
    removing a kernel version mentioned in boot loader configuration.
  * Have the minimal.mk not overwrite the control or the changelog file. 
  * Added a whole slew of config files, and updated older ones, to bring
    the configurations offered up by default to be more in line with
    official kernels.
  * Fixed substitutions in the kernel image package, there was a duplicate
    =B substitution. 
  * Ran lintian on all the generated packages. Fixed FSF address in all
    the copyright notices, and fixed case in the templates file as
    well. This shall be the last experimental release, barring major
    problems.

kernel-package (10.004) experimental; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: "using debconf", thanks to Robert Millan      (Closes: #115884)
  * Bug fix: "does not install non-interactively", thanks to Matt Kraai
                                                           (Closes: #247782)
  * This fine tunes the dependencies between targets. All of the package
    building targets are ones that insert themselves into the normal flow
    of policy specified targets, so they must hook themselves into the
    stream. That means, in essence, that they must depend on the configure
    and  corresponding build targets (with stamps) and ensure that the
    prep work is all done before they are invoked. The advantage is that
    nothing is going to be remade more often than it needs to. It also
    means we do not need to produce as many stamp files. So, the only
    dependencies on any of the intermediate targets are targets that have
    not been registered into the ladder created in rulesets/common/targets.mk
  * The kernel image maintainer scripts have been greatly
    changed. Firstly, they now use  debconf; and a number of questions
    have been moved to the config file (create-kimage-link-$version,
    old-initrd-link, old-dir-initrd-link, old-system-map-link) while
    others are asked conditionally in the postinst (depmod-error,
    depmod-error-initrd, bootloader-test-error, bootloader-error). The
    postinst has also become far less verbose; the users are far better
    educated a decade after this was written, and there are other sources
    of information about booting than the postinst of a kernel image.
  * The preinst also uses debconf. All the questions asked are still here
    -- we just use debconf to ask the user. Also, the priority, and need
    to break non-interactive installs was re-evaluated, and the preinst
    breaks in far fewer cases than it did before. 
  * Second, the postinst gets rid of the code that generated boot floppies
    and created lilo.conf (that latter was probably illegal under current
    policy anyway). The do_boot_enable and do_boot_floppy configuration
    variables in /etc/kernel-img.conf are now invalid.
  * Also, the source tree is not automatically cleaned; the do_clean
    configuration variable, and the environment variable CLEAN_SOURCE are
    now control if the source tree is optionally cleaned after the kernel
    image package is built.

kernel-package (10.003) experimental; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: "can not clean up the kernel source tree", thanks to           
    Chun-Chung Chen.                                        
  * Bug fix: "kernel-package creates packages depending on
    linux-initramfs-tools, should use linux-initramfs-tool", thanks to
    Thomas  Luzat.                                         
  * Bug fix: "/usr/share/doc/kernel-package seems to contain broken
    symlinks", thanks to Thomas Luzat                       
  * This is a major reorganization of the rules file that helps
    create kernel related packages. The crusty old mechanism has been
     removed, the targets are now streamlined, and the policy mandated
     dependencies are now called out into a separate file. This should allow
     a future enhancement to allow end users to override the behavior of
     kernel-package in a fine grained fashion. Also, separating out the
     variable setting for each arch into a separate file should facilitate
     the delegation of that file to the person responsible for kernel images
     for that architecture. And, separating out the policy mandated targets
     into fine grained double colon targets allows people to add in any
     additional make targets for a particular architecture, something long
     requested. 
            One of the factors that made the build mechanism so complex was
     that the rules file had a dual purpose: Initially, when ./debian was not
     present or not populated, it was responsible for populating that, and
     then it was responsible for building the kernel packages, incorporating
     any user customizations.
            Unfortunately, since Make reads all the commands at startup, it
     was difficult to incorporate any customizations, but the modularization
     of the rules file makes it possible to have two top level files, a
     minimal make file whose sole responsibility is to populate ./debian (and
     run clean even when ./debian does not exist), and which uses some of the
     same variable setting make snippets that the final top level Make file
     uses when it resides in ./debian. The task of deciding which top level
     makefile to use has now been relegated to /usr/bin/make-kpkg -- which,
     if there ./debian is empty or not present, first calls the minimal
     Makefile to populate it, and _then_ calls the real ./debian/rules file
     to perform the actual task that it was asked. This little intelligence
     in make-kpkg allows the minimal makefile, and ./debian/rules, to be far
     simpler, and allows them to conform to the standards my other Debian
     packages adhere to.
            The goal of this release was to handle the bugs in the previous
     experimental release, but to create a set of packages indistinguishable
     from the ones created before. Pointedly, non-of the minor lacunae in the
     Debian kernel image postinst scripts have been addressed yet. Also, the
     build process is a little more verbose at the moment than it needs to be.

kernel-package (10.002) experimental; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: "kernel-package: Problem with kernel_version.mk causes build
    fauilure", thanks to Horms                               (Closes: #335993).
  * This is a fairly large reorganization of the directory and file layout
    for the package. Instead of a mostly flat directory structure with a
    giant monolithic rules files, we are moving towards a more organized
    structure, with finer granularity of files, which may in the future
    facilitate third party replacement and overriding of parts of the build
    mechanism. Also, this reorganization may make the overall structure
    easier to see (though it may also result in it being harder to get the
    big picture, but I doubt that).

    This time around, I am trying to keep substantive changes to a minimum,
    so files have just been broken up, moved around, but the package should
    still more or less behave the way that it always did (apart from changing
    the stem).
    * kernel/rules (DEBDIR): Test to see if we have
      ./debian/kernel_version.mk, since all kinds of other people create
      ./debian 
   * Makefile (install): Adjust for the reorganization of the files, since
     the source files are no longer in their previous locations. Keep the
     destination mostly the same.
   * kernel/rules: This is the one file that has faced the brunt of the
     changes. Large chunks of it have been moved out into separate chunks
     included in this file. The major addition has been are mechanisms to
     allow the file to be broken up. The parts removed are
      o) dpkg-architecture variable are now moved out to
         ruleset/common/archvars.mk 
      o) The variables set in the file have mostly been moved to
         ruleset/local-vars.mk, which shall be further broken up into
         smaller parts
      o) For example, the per arch variable settings have already been moved
         out of  ruleset/local-vars.mk into ruleset/architecture.mk -- and
         shall be further fragmented into files in ruleset/arches/, so that
         it would be easier to delegate ownership to domain experts.
      o) The action/rules part of the file have been broken out to
         ruleset/local.mk -- and shall be broken out into
         ruleset/common/targets.mk (which contain policy mandated targets,
         and their dependencies, and ruleset/actual_rules.mk, where the
         grunt work shall be done. It may make sense to further divide
         ruleset/actual_rules.mk into separate files for images, headers,
         doc, and manual packages. At a later stage, actually installing
         files into ./debian/tmp-<something> shall be separated out from the
         subsequent packaging into separate targets (probably in the same
         file), to allow finer granularity for debugging.

kernel-package (10.001) experimental; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: "doesn't install: Internal Error: Could not find image
    (/boot/vmlinuz-2.4.27-xxs1500)", thanks to Martin Michlmayr. Well,
    calling kimage vmlinux.srec was breaking the postinst. However, kimage
    does not seem to be used anywhere except in determining the next
    value, namely, kimagesrc -- so I just added .srec to  kimagesrc, and
    thus eliminated the need for hacking the postinst. So the fix was
    earlier in the build process, and not deferred to the postinst.
                                                          (Closes: #333220).
  * Acknowledge the changes made for initrd stuff in the NMU
    series. Thanks to Sven Luther for the work. I have made some changes,
    for example, instead of hard-coding the list of initrd tools one
    considers in the installation phase, now one can set that list by
    editing /etc/kernel-pkg.conf -- and this replaces the hard coded
    list. Of course, the admin at the target location can still over-ride
    that list by editing /etc/kernel-img.con (note, not the same as
    /etc/kernel-pkg.conf above); this makes things slightly more
    flexible. Also, the list of commands does not have to be the fully
    qualified path, the postinst and preinst use the PATH variable to find
    the commands.
  * kernel-img.conf.5: Document the fact that the ramdisk variable can now
    be a space separated list of init ram disk creation commands, which
    need to also support the --supported-host-version and
    --supported-target-version options, just like mkinitrd does. This is
    the list tried at installation time.
  * kernel-pkg.conf.5: Document the fact that one can provide the default
    values for the list by setting INITRD_CMD, but this list can be
    overridden by the one in kernel-img.conf.5. However, the defaults are
    set to a subset of "mkinitrd mkinitrd.yaird mkinitramfs", the subset
    being decided based on the version of the kernel being built, so one
    should refrain from setting this manually -- unless one knows what one
    is doing.
  * kernel/image.postrm, kernel/image.prerm: Added new variable for the
    initrd dependency, and also modified the variable ramdisk to be a
    space separated list of commands, not just a single command.
  * kernel/image.postinst, kernel/image.preinst: Added new variable for
    the initrd dependency, and also modified the variable ramdisk to be a
    space separated list of commands, not just a single
    command. (find_inird_tool): Added function to determine the list of
    viable initrd creation tools present on the target system, and use it
    to select which tool to use for creating the ram fs.
  * Bug fix: "'man make-kpkg' typo: 'thatthis'", thanks to A
    Costa                                                    (Closes: #335316).

    for older kernels. Please note that while one may install any number

  * Added a few bits and pieces for powerpc64 into the rules file. I am
    not sure I understand why one can't ever cross compile powerpc64
    images, but I am adding this in for the duration. This work reflects

kernel-package (9.000) unstable; urgency=low

  * This is a bug fixing release, and hopefully stable. Next we embark on
    a cleanup, rewrite, and debconfification, so this may well be a
    version worth holding on to.
  * Bug fix: "kernel-package: Rearrange docs placement in kernel-doc",
    thanks to Eugene Konev                              (Closes: #308562).
  * Bug fix: "kernel-package: Please export KERNEL_ARCH variable to the
    post-install script", thanks to Jurij Smakov        (Closes: #309423).
  * Bug fix: "kernel-package: [INTL:es] updated make-kpkg manpage", thanks
    to Ruben Porras                                     (Closes: #310274).
  * Bug fix: "kernel-package: Does not clean up dangling 'source' symlink
    in postinst", thanks to Jurij Smakov                (Closes: #309981).
  * Bug fix: "kernel-package: Please disable the version mismatch check
    for official kernels", thanks to Jurij Smakov. As all the debian
    kernel images are built from the same source, but with different
    binary image versions (the binary image version is a combination of
    the sub-arch and a variation of the kernel ABI), this check is
    erroneously triggered for them, terminating the build. With the patch
    builds finish fine.  This does so by circumventing a sanity check,
    which has some value for the end user.              (Closes: #312280).

kernel-package (8.135) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Bug fix: "kernel-package incompatible with experimental dpkg", thanks
    to Thomas Luzat. The problem is that dpkg-architecture
    -qDEB_HOST_GNU_SYSTEM output haschanged for Linux, resulting in
    kernel-package failing to figure out the system time. So, added
    DEB_HOST_ARCH_OS, which is only supported in the dpkg in experimental
    so far. This ain't ever gonna get into Sarge, but   shall be in
    Etch. Try to cope with the dpkg released with Sarge, as   well as the
    future dpkg that shall be in Etch. Discussed with RM, and this was
    deemed wrthy of pushing into Sarge                   (Closes: #307587).

    thanks to Paul Boehm. Most of the porting and testing has been done by
    Felix Erkinger <erkinger@gmx.net>, and all the credit goes to him.

kernel-package (8.103) unstable; urgency=high

  * Bug fix: "make-kpkg: fails to unpatch the source", thanks to martin f
    krafft. This was due to recent idiocy in upstream kernel sources,
    where the kernel now assumes responsibility of ./debian directory
    (despite Debian having used this directory for years). The people in
    charge of this code in upstream kernel were not competent enough to
    implement the deb target  in a fashion that it does not break a
    facility that Debian has used for years.  Well, all the kernel-patch
    packages are affected; since nothing shall unpatch correctly with
    2.6.8.1+ kerel versions. It also makes life a pain for official kernel
    image developers, since their ./debian is a dorectory that is not
    recreated by kernel-package (or the broken upstream code); and at
    least one developer has lost an uncheked in  custom ./debian dir
  
    It is not as if they needed to claim ./debian, since they do not use
    dpkg, and a fix was discussed in August, but no one has seen fit to
    implement that fix and solve this breakage -- so now kerel-package
    works around this idiocy. This makes this update very urgent.
  
    The generated .debs also do not pay attention to kernel-img.conf (thus
    creating a surprise for unsuspecting end users), they do not massage
    the build and source symlinks, do not run boot loaders, do not handle
    bootloaders that may use initrd in their config, and probably would
    end up generating a slew of bugs that can't be fixed in Debian.
  
                                                         (Closes: #270169).
  * Bug fix: "make-kpkg doesn't handle CONFIG_LOCALVERSION", thanks to
    Michal Čihař. The only implementation for LOCALVERSION I saw (in
    linux-2.6.9-rc3/Makefile), is a broken Makefile
    snippet. kernel-package now tries to implement what the documentation
    and comment say should be done                       (Closes: #273147).
  * Added support for hook directories. Apart from hook variables that the
    local admin may set, there are a set of directories where packages, or
    the local admin, may drop in script files. The directories are
      - /etc/kernel/preinst.d/,
      - /etc/kernel/postinst.d/,
      - /etc/kernel/prerm.d/, and 
      - /etc/kernel/postrm.d/.
    If they exists, the kernel-image package shall run a run-parts program
    over the directory, giving the version being installed or removed as
    an argument, in the corresponding phase of installation or
    removal. Since these directories do not exist by default, this should
    have no impact on current installations.

  * Strip the uml binary (honoring DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS).

    problems when we try to install two different kenrl-uml-* packages,
    since they now conflict with each other. Now, we just conflict with
    user-mode-linux (>= 2.0), which means all kernel-uml-* packages shall
    conflict with real user-mode-linux packages, but not with other
    kernel-uml packages.

  * More modifications to the kernel-uml-$version packages created. Now
    the modules live in /usr/lib/modules/ instead of in

    have multiple uml images on the machine at the same time, while still
    retaining a /usr/bin/linux and a man page for that.  Rewrote the man
    page from scratch.                                       (Closes: #176288).

    UML packages. Try something like this:
      make-kpkg --revision 1um-1 --arch um  kernel-image
    the resulting package will be called:
      kernel-uml-<version>_<revision>_<buildarch>.deb
    It will include the linux executable in /usr/bin, and the uml modules
    in /usr/share/kernel-uml/modules/$VERSION/

  * Bug fix: "kernel-package: --append-to-version and modules_image don't
    get along", thanks to Daniel Jacobowitz. Starting with kernel version
    2.6.X, the build process for third party modules has been modified;
    now modules are expected to build in hte kenrel sources dir, and you
    set the SUBDIR arg to point to the source for the module itself. This
    arranges for the kernel makefiles to do all the boilerplate work of
    building/running modpost, dependencies, et cetera. The problem is that
    unless the module passes in the same  EXTRAVERSION=XYZ argument that
    the main kernel build process did,  include/linux/version.h shall be
    regenerated, with a different value  now than when the kernel was
    compiled. The only way to avoid this is to make sure the module passes
    EXTRAVERSION also; the 2.6 kernel makefile is very enthusiastic about
    making sure version.h is up to  date. So, make-kpkg now passes a new
    parameter, KPKG_EXTRAV_ARG, to the module; the value is either empty,
    or a string like "EXTRAVERSION=X.Y.Z". The idea is that you can call
    $(MAKE) $(KPKG_EXTRAV_ARG) ... in the modules package and have the
    same version.h info as the main kernel image does.  (Closes: #233152).

    can enhance the symlinks policy to better suit their needs. This

    people. I do not think that these should become the mainstream model;
    since the numbers of kernels linked to, the numbers of streams (2.4,
    2.5, -selinux, etc) depend so much on the local install. Instead, the
    vanilla symlink policy should be the default, as it is now, but now
    people can implement whatever policy they choose.

    'debian/rules clean' before it calls 'debian/rules binary'.  To insure
    the package is in a sane state if it was previously built, make

kernel-package (7.44) unstable; urgency=low

  * There was a problem  while installing a kernel with no modules created
    with a new, more helpful kernel-package, which tries to run depmod
    during install (This helps people who are replacing the running kernel
    with a new kernel with the same version).  I have now fixed the
    postinst to check whether the directory exists before calling depmod.
                                                            closes: Bug#99105
  * Fixed spelling errors in make-kpkg(1).                  closes: Bug#99454
  * Remove empty /lib/modules/$version dir in postinst if empty. dpkg did
    not remove the directory, obviously since there were files it was not
    aware of created by depmod, however these were removed by the postrm
    correctly, but it neglected to remove the empty directory. 
                                                             closes: Bug#99880 
  * Fixed another typo in the image postinst.                closes: Bug#101524
  * Changed the loaderdep= field for IA-64 to be 'elilo' instead of
    'lilo-efi'.                                              closes: Bug#100321

  * make-kpkg doesn't work with 2.4.5 and up on PowerPC, since all of the
    *boot directories were merged, renamed and moved around. The included
    fixes this, and also removed the BeBox target bits.  BeBox isn't
    supported in Linux 2.2.x or 2.4.x                        closes: Bug#103032

    on the bug report                                        closes: Bug#103531
  * Now add documentation to the effect that if one runs make (menu|x)?config
    to configure the kernel, it creates `include/linux/version.h', which
    contains the kernel version without_ the append_to_version data. This
    file won't be updated by the make-kpkg run (make-kpkg creates
    version.h if it doesn't exist, but doesn't touch if exists), so the
    final kernel will _not_ have the append_to_version data in its version
    number. Now kernel-package moans about the file, and allows you to
    abort early.                                   closes: Bug#97202, Bug#98908

kernel-package (7.42) unstable; urgency=low

  * Softened the stance about hyphens in revision strings that was adopted
    in 7.28. The documentation still strongly deprecates the use of
    hyphens in the revision, since no checks are in place to ensure the
    resulting version is legal. Now, a warning is generated at the
    beginning warniong that this may cause a problem at the tail end of a
    long compile, and the user is responsible for selecting a version
    string that shall not cause dpkg and friends to choke. This is at the
    request of the official pcmlcia-modules maintainer (Hi Brian)

    would allow hyphens, but no checks were then in place to ensure the

    fairly expensive kernel compile. I think I am going to standardize on
    not allowing hyphens, cause then the checks already in place are
    sufficient, and I think it is reasonable not to have debian revisions
    for kernel-image-X.X.XX packages (in a way, these packages are really

    step before running make modules_image, if one wishes to skip building
    the kernel image itself. 
  * Added links to more documentation in the /usr/share/doc/kernel-package
    directory.

kernel-package (7.08) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a space after a question the postinst asks.
  * Added a spacs after --backup=t while copying. This would cause things
    to break otherwise. 
  * Added a / in the error message when no_symlinks is on.
  * Fix the README to talk about no_symlinks, and not no_symlink. 
    fixes Bug # 63606
  * Added three more directives for kernel-imge.conf, namely,
    do_boot_enable, do_bootfloppy, and do_bootloader. All default to YES.
    closes: Bug#63607
  * Added a check in the makefloppy routine to make sure the image we are
    trying to write exists. This closes: Bug#63558
  * Capture the stderr too when testing the bootloaders. This fixes Bug
    63599 
  *  Fixed PPC setup to handle new powermacs. This was a (grave) RC
    bug. This fixes Bug# 63559
  * Added checks and guards to ensue that 63558 would be caught and more
    information provided. Insufficient data as yet to figure out what is
    causing it.

kernel-package (7.07) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix a (cosmetic) bug in the preinst that printed a message in the
    wrong fork. closes: Bug#63409
  * Hmm. chdir to / before testing whether something is a directory. test
    for it being a dir before stripping the leading / off. Either one of
    these changes would fix the bugs reported. closes: Bug#63419, Bug#63388

kernel-package (7.06) unstable; urgency=low

  * Somehow, kernel-doc-blah was never made to have /usr/doc links; it is
    fixed in this version. 
  * Added a new option to kernel package to allow specifying which modules
    one means to compile when doing the modulkes targets - this also
    allows people to use kernel-package to compile modules in non standard
    location, by giving a full path for the module directory. 
    closes: Bug#54807

kernel-package (7.05) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed image postinst to allow people to specify they want the image
    moved from /boot into some other location (for example, loadlin users)
    closes: Bug#61832
  * Changed the default version number from 1.00. closes: Bug#62836
  * Can't reproduce .config being deleted (and indeed, there is not code
    in lernel-package that directly deletes that file). I'm closing this
    bug until we get a reproducible problem, or at least more
    details. Until then, just chalk it up to happenstance. 
    closes: Bug#61606
  * Make sure we ignore spaces in the value of the HOSTCC and CC env
    variables. 
  * Make the source package suggest task-tcltk-dev, rather than tk-dev,
    since the latter is no longer provided by modern packages (apparently
    it was not meant to be a publically used virtual package)
  * Rewrote the preinst to pay attention to the kernel-img.conf. Added a
    variable called clobber_modules that shall have the preinst move
    /lib/modules/version dir out of the way silently. (I strongly suggest
    that this varible not be set unless you know what you are
    doing). closes: Bug#62745
  * Added (courtesey of Peter Moulder) a new option called --config to
    make-kpkg, which allows you to specify what configure target shallb e
    used by make-kpkg. Defaults to oldconfig. This was added so you can
    run your usual config step _after_ the kernel has been patched by
    make-kpkg. closes: Bug#61503
  * Added a new target to make-kpkg, called debian, which essentially
    creates a ,.debian directory and runs the kernel patch process. This
    is so you have an alternative to using --config; you can just call
    make-kpkg debian, make menuconfig, make-kpkg ....

kernel-package (7.04) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Make sure that version specific kernel-patch subdirectories are
    supported for the all directory as well (they were supported for arch
    specific patches already). closes: Bug#61915
  * Fixed misplaced backslash (it was one char off)  - bad if a patch
    changes the location the kernel will search for its modules!  This is
    RC for powerpc kernel images. closes: Bug#62015

kernel-package (7.03) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Aaargh. A single space got inserted into thepostinst after my
    testing. I was just adding comments, I swear. I'll not add anything
    after the test, I promise. "$_/$loader_exec " => "$_/$loader_exec".  
    This fixes an important bug, which caused lilo not to be run on
    installing the kernel image. closes: Bug#61646

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Mon,  3 Apr 2000 11:16:06 -0500

kernel-package (7.02) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a dependency on fileutiles >=4.0, since the package would fail
    to install with older fileutils. This prevents a failure to install
    when upgrading from slink. 
  * Added a simple check on upppercase chars in the version
    string. closes: Bug#61213
  * Made the dependency in kernel-source packagesbe for libncurses-dev |
    ncurses-dev, since the latter is being phased out. This is an
    important fix.
  * The changes added in 7.00 are required to be in potato. The changes
    were: Allow the official kernel-* package maintainer some leeway in
    providing official control files (just like they can provide their own
    changelog files now).

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Thu, 30 Mar 2000 10:19:28 -0600

kernel-package (7.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added more documentation to the install time configuration file
    kernel-img.conf.5. Modified the image postinst to be more lax in
    parsing configuration options

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Tue, 21 Mar 2000 10:37:46 -0600

kernel-package (7.00) unstable; urgency=low

  * Allow the official kernel-* package maintainer some leeway in
    providing official control files (just like they can provide their own
    changelog files now).
  * On user request, do not fail to make symbolic links in / merely
    because the system does not ahve the default bootloader installed --
    people are using alternative boot loaders out there. Instead there is
    a config file that can provide the answer -- oif the config file does
    not exists, the postinst asks the user, and creates the config file.

kernel-package (6.41) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added the version number of the kernel to both the short and the long
    description, to help people decide what packages are installed and
    which new ones they may wish to install. 
  * Make sure one uses absolute symlinks where required, when creating
    /usr/doc symlinks

kernel-package (6.40) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Path up modules_install in the kernel_image target to include some new
    module categories in 2.3.XX kernels. In order that this does not, in
    the futire, inconvenience people, use the kernel Makefile to install
    modules when we can. The cases we can't use the kernel makefile is for

  * Fixed an upgrade bug when /usr/doc happens to be a symlink, and does

  * The postinst was vulnerable to being affected by symlinks (if, for
    some reason, the prerm failed). This has happended for latex2html; and
    created a grave bug. 
  * There was a bug in the postinst in a case statement, that caused

kernel-package (6.33) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Make kernel-packageconfig escape single "'"s in the maintainer
    name. Now irish eyes should be smilin' again ;-). This is a bug fix,
    since it causes make-kpkg to fail for people with apostrophes in their
    names.
  * Add warning if using --revision with an official kernel source (in
    other words if ./debian/official exists). Added this also to the man
    page for make-kpkg; this apparently has been causing confudion.
  * closes: Bug#56506, Bug#56544, Bug#56632

    potato version is broken (a grave bug); this fixes it. This version
    also has undergone extensive testing, complete with building modules,

  * Never release a version without a full install test. There were typos
    in 6.30 which made it not work
  * Pulled back the support for HOSTCC and CC variables in make-kpkg,
    since it caused all modules to fail. In fact, just setting CC=gcc
    causes havoc. modules tested: alsa-source, lmsensors, and

  * Dixed the Multi-Arch document so that the patch and unpatch example
    scripts do not wipe out stamp files. Also noted that the files in the

    require the revision flag to only contain anlphanumerics and . and +,
    and error out if otherwise. closes: Bug#35951
  * The control file is fed $architecure, which needs be a valid arch
    string. The additional -D option to dpkg-gencontrol is needed for
    cross compilation (the default arch that dpkg-gencontrol guesses is
    not the target architecture). So dpkg-gencontrol has to be told what
    is in the control file. closes: Bug#37998

kernel-package (6.05) frozen unstable; urgency=high

  * This fixes a bug introduced in the previous upload to frozen, in the
    handling of the new extraversion. Most of the changes are bug fixes,
    there is no new code.
  * Tightened the reg exp for determining the extraversion to ignore
    whitespace. Use builtin strip to remove leading and trailing
    space. fixes: BUG#32457 
  * If the changelog exists, use it to guess at the debian version (this is
    merely setting the default value). If there is no changelog, the
    default is still 1.00.
  * If the .config file exists, use that to guess the subarch for intel
    platforms. 
  * Install debian/rules if it does not exist, regardless of
    stamp-configure or debian/official.  fixes: BUG# 31823.

kernel-package (6.03) frozen unstable; urgency=high

  * This update fixes a release critical bug, and only includes bug fixes
    since the previous version in frozen, apart from making the package
    2.2.X ready (mostly EXTRAVERSION support). I strongly feel that this
    should be allowed in frozen, even in deep freeze.
  * Added an option arch_in_name to ask kernel package to embedd the sub
    architecture in the kernel image name (this reverses the default of
    always embedding the arch in the name). Note that only the image
    package _name_ is affected. fixes: BUG#31972
  * The new Power macs report themselves as Power Macintoshes rather than
    PwerMac's. Changed reg expression to allow either. fixes: BUG#32262
  * Also install NET_MISC_MODULES modules. fixes: BUG#31934, BUG#31936

    include the architecture string that kernel-image packages may
    optionally have. fixes: Bug#30291
  * The EXTRAVERSION support in the NMU fixes: BUG#31290, BUG#31331, BUG#31444
  * Added docuemntation about more variables in the makefile, namely, the
    locations of the modules, patches, and configuration files, and how
    one may modify the defaults.

kernel-source-0.34 (1.01)  unstable; urgency=low

  * This is a major change in the source/header packages. In architectures
    different from i386, `kernel-headers-*' and `kernel-source-*' are
    incompatible. This also has an effect on libc6-dev, which depends on
    kernel-headers-2.0.3x | kernel-source-2.0.3x, which is only true on
    i386 architectures. One possible solution would be to make libc6-dev
    depend on kernel-headers-2.0.32, but that won't work because
    kernel-source provides kernel-headers. In fact, since kernel-headers
    are arch dependent, but kernel-source is arch: all, kernel-source-*
    should not provide kernel-header* at all. 
    
    Once kernel source stops providing kernel-header*, and libc6-dev
    depends on kernel-headers-2.0.32 and links /usr/include/{linux,asm} to
    /usr/src/kernel-headers-2.0.32 (nor /usr/src/linux-2.0.32) things
    would work again in a Multi arch compatible fashion.
  
    Hence, now kernel-source-* packages compiled with this kernel-package
    shall not provide any sort of kernel-headers. For the sake of
    backwards compatibility, /usr/src/linux-$version symlinks are still
    being provided (as people may upload newer kernels while keeping an
    older libc6-dev around, which depends on /usr/src/linux-2.0.32. 
  
    However, I have been badgered enough about this that I shall remove
    the /usr/src/linux-$version symlinks at some point. This version no
    longer registers stuff in /usr/src/.linux-versions, and is no longer
    as paranoid about /usr/src/linux; but it does not outright remove
    those files either, so as not to cause people with older kernels
    having a problem during removal.As soon as it is deemed permissible,
    we shall get less paranoid about /usr/src/linux-$version as well.

kernel-source-0.33 (1.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added SUBARCH, which is used to distinguish Amiga, Atari, Macintosh,
    etc. kernels for Debian/m68k, and may well be required for the alpha,
    from what I hear. Unlike the FLAVOURS variable, which affects
    everything it can lay its grubby hands on (kernel image, headers,
    source, doc package versions, and where the modules are looked for
    under /lib/modules), this only affects the naming of the kernel-image
    as the source and doc packages are architecture independent and the
    kernel-headers do not vary from one sub-architecture to the
    next. These changes are courtesy of James Troup <J.J.Troup@scm.brad.ac.uk>

kernel-source-0.32 (1.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ensure that the /usr/src/linux and /usr/src/linux-<version> links
    always exist, no matter what. Apparently, upgrading from
    kernel-source-2.0.32_2.0.32-1 to kernel-source-2.0.32_2.0.32-3 does
    not create /usr/src/linux-<version>, which breaks libc6-dev.
  * Toned down the language about LILO, so as not to startle new sparc users

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Thu, 12 Feb 1998 21:56:50 -0600

kernel-source-0.31 (1.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added ARCH to make called, this allows for cross compiling kernels
    (added on a request by  James Troup <J.J.Troup@scm.brad.ac.uk>)
  * Make kernel-headers arch: any, so we can indeed have different headers
    for different architectures.
  * m68k can now handle vmlinuz, so reverse that behaviour in the rules
    file. AFAIK m68k still uses zImage.
  * Improvements to /usr/doc/kernel-patch/MultiArch.gz, based on
    suggestions by James Troup <J.J.Troup@scm.brad.ac.uk>/

kernel-source-0.30 (1.01) unstable; urgency=low

kernel-source-0.29 (1.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * Important changes for kernel-source-* and kernel-header-* packages: now
    kernel-source-* packages also provide the exact kernel-header-* (libc6
    need only depend on kernel-header-* now.
  * The kernel-header-* and kernel-source-* packages now also maitain the
    /usr/src/linux-X.YY.ZZ links (in addition to the /usr/src/linux links)
    This is used in the libc6 package.

kernel-source-0.28 (1.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a typo where we tried to dd /vmlinuz-2.0.32 rather than the
    correct /boot/vmlinuz-2.0.32 in image.postinst. How come this glaring
    an error has gone unreported until now?

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Fri, 23 Jan 1998 14:36:34 -0600

kernel-source-0.27 (1.01) unstable; urgency=low

 * Fixed Typo in kernel rules that put all modules into block (this
    is more of a thinko/cut and paste error. fixes: Bug#16697,Bug#16702
  * No longer a fatal error if there is no /vmlinuz (or
    equivalent). fixes: Bug#16899
  * Added language to the abort on /usr/src/linux not being a
    link. 
  * Documented the fact that if you re-run make-kpkg with a different
    revision number, you have to reconfigure the kernel. 
    fixes: Bug#16968
  * ignore obsolete fdformat in favour of superformat.
  * Changed the kernel rules file not break on the sound modules of
    2.1.70+ kernels (I think it is a bug in the kernel Makefile, but this
    fix make make-kpkg handle the problem and be more robust).
  * Modified image.postinst to also cater to people on whose architecture
    the image is not called vmlinuz but something else (like vmlinux, for
    example). closes:Bug#16258
  * Made the postrm's also know about the kernel versrion, not just the
    postinst. (Sorry). closes:Bug#15920
  * Changed include.postrm to be more careful about removing the symbolic
    link /usr/src/linux-X.Y.Z. Keep track if there is another package
    installed that could provide the link.

kernel-source-0.25 (1.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ignore unmounted devices while looking for a root file system. Much
    thanks to Thomas Kocourek <tko@westgac3.dragon.com> for noticing
    this. 
  * Make sure that the copyright file for the kernel-doc package is not
    compressed. closes:Bug#14403,Bug#14405

kernel-source-0.24 (1.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * Install the README.headers in the right place for the source

    kernels. closes:Bug#14527.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Wed,  5 Nov 1997 23:30:48 -0600

kernel-source-0.23 (1.-0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added README.headers to the kernel-source package as well, since the
    information _is_ relevant to compiling kernels. Since kernel source
    packages have higher visibility than kernel header packages, this may
    help avoid some FAQs from being asked.
  * Changed image postinst not to use the obsolete -d option to
    superformat. Removed extra spaces from the exec option, so that it is
    more likely to work. Noticed by Joost Kooij <kooij@mpn.cp.philips.com>
  * Note that the proposed two level versioning scheme fails if standard
    kernels use epochs. Further note that one may introduce epochs even in
    custom kernels. 

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Thu, 23 Oct 1997 12:19:51 -0500

kernel-source-0.22 (1.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * Handle obsolete /System.map and /System.old links left around by older
    kernel-package packages. All the programs that look at the information
    in the map files (including top, ps, and klogd) also will look at
    /boot/System.map-<version>, we just need to ensure that that file is
    present, and no longer require the symbolic link. 
    Actually, having the symbolic link in / is technically detrimental
    (apart from cluttering up /); many programs, though looking in /boot,
    still allow /System.map to override. If you use LILO to choose between
    multiple kernels, then the /System.map symbolic link only applies to
    one such kernel, for all other choices the symbols loaded will be
    wrong. Not having the symbolic links at all prevents this. 
    Therefore, the new image.postinst file shall offer to remove the
    symbolic links in /. This should fix BUG#13359

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Fri, 26 Sep 1997 10:44:39 -0500

kernel-source-0.21 (1.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed handling of modules.dep in the image.postinst. We do not attempt
    to recreate a modules.dep, since the man page admits the file so
    created may be incorrect. We warn the installer that there maybe
    problems loading modules into the kernel until reboot iff the version
    being installed is the same as the version currently running.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Tue, 16 Sep 1997 15:07:02 -0500

kernel-source-0.20 (1.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * No longer create a System.map symlink in /, since that may confuse
    klogd when choosing kernel images using LILO. Since top, ps, and klogd
    look at /boot/System.map-<version>, we just need to make sure that
    file is present. This makes us friendlier to multiple images of the
    same kernel version.
  * No longer redirect output to a file in /tmp for security reasons (we
    use a log file in /var/log instead). This fixes BUG#11765,
    BUG#11766 and BUG#11847 
  * Added support for different flavours of the same kernel version for
    people who need them. This is based on the ideas and work of Bill
    Mitchell <mitchell@mozcom.com> and Noel Maddy <ncm@biostat.hfh.edu>.
    This should make us fully compliant to having multiple flavours of the
    same kernel version. 
  * Added dependencies to targets in rules. Now things should work as
    expected if one edits a .config file. 
  * Fixed destination for the Buildinfo file. This fixes BUG#11884.

kernel-source-0.19 (1.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * All kernel packages produced now list the version of kernel-package
    used in the file /usr/doc/Buildinfo.
  * The image prerm will allow you to remove an running kernel image and
    hose your system. You will be warned. (under protest).
  * Fixed typo in control file for kernel-doc description. This fixes
    Bug#11568.

kernel-source-0.18 (1.01) unstable; urgency=low

    not anymore create /boot/psdatabase-X.X.XX. The psdatabase file does
    not seem to be required anymore.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Wed, 18 Jun 1997 13:05:33 -0500

kernel-source-0.17 (1.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added patches to support m68k from "Frank Neumann"

kernel-source-0.16 (1.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved config to /boot, where it arguably should have gone to in the
    first place. The /boot directory contains other information pertinent 
    to the kernel, such as the System.map file, and the psdatabase.  The 
    information about exactly what was configured into the kernel was 
    missing, and it can get quite critical on some machines.  Also, the 
    config file may serve as a base for compiling the next kernel. This 
    file is not really a configuration file (not when packaged as part of 
    the kernel-image package), hence it does not belong in /etc (no amout 
    of changing this file will have any affet on system behaviour).

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Wed, 21 May 1997 01:44:17 -0500

kernel-source-0.15 (1.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * Kernel-image and kernel-doc now suggest each other.
  * Also recognize powerpc as a synonym for ppc in determining whether
    we use zImage or bzImage by default.
  * Fixed up some typos in documentation
  * Added rules target kernel_doc. This fixes BUG#9138
  * Also install .config file under /usr/doc. This fixes BUG#9298

kernel-source-0.13 (1.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * Really add in all the changes sent in by Herbert Xu. The changes are: 
    * Changed to source package name back to kernel-source-=V again. 
    * Changed the installs to be without -o root -g root since it is no
      longer useful as the chowns are done before the packages are built. It
      also means that if it is used in targets like stamp-configure which may
      be run by anyone it won't not generate an error.
    * Made rules file generate the control file.
    * Fixed some typos in chown commands while generating the header
      packages. 

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Mon, 21 Apr 1997 15:12:19 -0500

 kernel-source-0.12 (1.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * Forgot to mention that the source package for the kernel packages 
    (produced by make-kpkg buildpackage, for example) has been changed to 
    not contain the kernel version as part of the name (all the deb files 
    produced have not changed), so we now get kernel-image-xxx_yy_zz.deb, 
    kernel-source-xxx_yy_zz.deb, and kernel-headers-xxx_yy_zz.deb, along
    with kernel-source.tar.gz and kernel-source_yy.diff.gz
  * Added changes from the kernel packages maintainer (this is the
    kernel-packages maintainer speaking, Herbert Xu handles the kernel
    image, headers, and source packages at the moment).

kernel-source-0.4 (1.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * kernel-source-X.XX now recommends bin86, which fixes Bug#4443

    package inspite of having headers in libc5-dev)
  * Added README files for all packages (the old README files became
    copyright files).
  * Added target for buildpackage (wich needed a hack in the target clean
    so as not to remove the ./debian directory prematurely)

kernel-source-0.2 (1.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made image.postinst more polite.
  * Also enabled kernel-{source,image,headers} targets in kernel.rules 
  * Changed make-kpkg to also accept the new targets.
  * Fixed typo in man page.
  * The man page says it is an administrators man page rather than a 
    programmers man page.
  * Recommended libc-dev for kernel-source and kernel-package
  * source suggests ncurses3.0-dev, tk40-dev and the description explains 
    you could use make menuconfig rather than plain old make config if you
    had these packages.
  * Fixed typo in the rules for modules in /usr/src/modules/ directory
  * Made the rules for such modules ignore errors (since they are not
    really a part of this package, error there should not halt this build
    (or so people seem to want it)
  * Look for modules in the kernel config file (or the default config file
    if the user has not supplied a config file), and only make modules and
    install them if modules have been configured in the config file. This 
    could be tested better.
  * Fixed the make-kpkg.8 man page so that it now does not seem to mandate
    a source and diff file for additional modules installed under the 
    directory /usr/src/modules/ (whether these files are produced is at
    the discretion of the maintainer of that modules package.
  * Make configure depend on stamp-configure which in turn depends on
    .config Hopefully, this will remake the image target if one changes
    the config file Hopefully, this will not cause the image target to
    build needlessly.

kernel-source-0.1 (1.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed the scripts to refer to /usr/bin/perl rather than /bin/perl.
  * Added an extended description to the image control file.
  * Added a note that the dist target requires a PGP key.
  * Fixed a typo (missing DEBDIR) in debian.rules.
  * Fixed the targets expected by make-kpkg (kernel_image rather than 
    kernel-image, etc).
  * In image.postinst, made arguments to system be a single argument if  
    the arguments contain shell meta-characters, (this way perl passes
    them to sh -c).
  * Made make-kpkg accept non floats as revision numbers, to facilitate  
    local names.
  * Fixed silly bug in makefloppy in image.postinst.
  * Fixed the extended description of the kernel-package package.
  * Updated the image postinst to install the mbr, if it exists, and to
    activate the root partition, and to not overwrite the mbr (oops).
  * Changed maintainer email address to debian.org (I'll be in a state of  
    flux soon)
