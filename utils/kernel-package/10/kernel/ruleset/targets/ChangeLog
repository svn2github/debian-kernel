	* image.mk (install/$(i_package)):
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-72
		  Move the clean hook out of here.
	  (debian/$(i_package)):
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-72
		  And into here. 

	* headers.mk (install/$(h_package)):
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-72
		  It was reported that the hooks called while various
		  kernel packages were being built were now called
		  _before_ the maintainer scripts were put into place,
		  preventing any modifications of these scripts. In some
		  cases, like the image and headers packages, it was
		  possible to move the hooks to a point just before the
		  package creation. In other cases, like for the source
		  package, this was not possible, since the source is
		  tarred up prior to packaging, and the hooks needs to be
		  run before the tarring is done. In the case of the manual
		  package, there was no hook invoked. Move the hook
		  invocation away from the install target. 
	  (debian/$(h_package)):
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-72
		  And invoke it here instead.

	* headers.mk:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-55
		  Restrict the search for ELF filesfor stripping to the
		  dir in which they are found; which may or may notbe
		  present. This vastly speeds up the generation.

	* source.mk (install/$(s_package)):
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-69
		  No longer mention FLAVOURS, since that is now gone. 

	* headers.mk (debian/$(h_package)):
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-55
		  Well, it turns out that only on some architectures do we
		  havea binary using a dynamically loaded shared library,
		  so the call to dpkg-shlibs was failing on the
		  others. Now, go throug a complex dance in which we
		  either call dpkg-shlibs, or edit the control file using
		  Perl, so that both cases can be catered to. 

	* image.mk:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-67
		  Export the variable IMAGE_TOP before calling scripts in
		  $(SRCTOP)/debian/image.d and debian/post-install, since
		  that is what they expected. 

2005-11-07  Manoj Srivastava  <srivasta@debian.org>

	* headers.mk:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-55
		  Add a whole slew of variables to the list of those to be
		  interpolated into the postinst and the create_link
		  script.  
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-55
		  typo fix. 
		  aparently, there was an elf binary in the package; and
		  we were missing a share lib dependency. Added a
		  call to dpkg-shlibdeps

	* headers.mk (install/$(h_package)):
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-55
		  create the /etc/kernel/postinst.d directory, and install
		  the script create link-VERSION there. 
	  (debian/$(h_package)):
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-55
		  Add the /etc/kernel/postinst.d/create_link-*file
		  to conffiles.

	* image.mk (debian/$(i_package)):
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-55
		  Add a config script, and a templates.master file for
		  debconf, with the proper substitutions.

	* target.mk:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-53

		  packages built, and also includes the files providing
		  commands to build each of the packages we create.

		  passed before creating a kernel package
