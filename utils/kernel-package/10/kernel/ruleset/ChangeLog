	* local.mk (kernel-image-deb stamp-kernel-image):
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-73
		  Add kernel-image-deb as a alias for stamp-kernel-image

	* minimal.mk (minimal_debian):
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-53
		  Do not ever write the control or the changelog if they
		  are already there. (probably the  official version).

	* local.mk (CLEAN/$(i_package)):
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-53
		  Ensure that the templates.master, and the templates, are
		  created even on clean, for the kernel image package.

	* modules.mk:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-53
		  This file contains the targets responsible for third
		  party module interaction. 

	* minimal.mk:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-53
		  New file. This is the new top level file used when the
		  clean target (which does not populate ./debian, indeed,
		  can remove it if present), and to populate ./debian, if
		  more complex tasks are to be performed. The population
		  of ./debian requires that certain variables be set, and
		  this file ensures we use the same makefile snippets that
		  ./debian/rules shall use when actually performing the
		  tasks, so there is no mismatch.  

	* local.mk:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-53
		  This is yet another of the files that has been reduced
		  to an outline. Apart from the buildpackage target, every
		  thing else has been moved out to file in the targets
		  subdirectory (the top level targets were already moved
		  to common/targets)

	* local-vars.mk:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-53
		  Made this file a skeleton/outline as well. All actual
		  variable settings (apart from the stuff to clean) are
		  now done in separate files (which allows us to have a
		  minimal.mk in the first place). 

	* architecture.mk:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/kernel-package--devel--9.0--patch-53
		  Converted this file into an skeleton/outline, to better
		  allow delegation of responsibility for each architecture
		  to the person in charge of kernel images for that arch.
