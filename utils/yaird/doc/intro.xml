    <application>Yaird</application> (Yet Another mkInitRD) is an
    application to create an initial boot image, a minimal filesystem used
    to bring a booting Linux kernel to a level where it can access
    the root file system and use startup scripts to bring the system
    to the normal run level.
 </para>

  <para>
    It differs from earlier <application>mkinitrd</application>
    implementations in that it attempts to leverage the information in
    sysfs to minimise the number of special cases that the application
    has to know about, and in that it uses a template system to separate
    the analysis of the system from the building of the image.

    This document gives an overview of the design and implementation
    of <application>Yaird</application>; see the README file for
    usage information.  This text assumes familiarity with Linux
    system administration and the basics of hotplug and sysfs.

    This document describes version &VERSION;
    of <application>Yaird</application>.
