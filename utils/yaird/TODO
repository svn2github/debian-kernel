Todo:
	- for the extended config file:
		- adapt news
	- verify ext2 => ext3 journal replay: journal should only
	  be done *after* fsck, so mount as ext2 in initramfs,
	  then as ext3 in /etc/init.d.
	- use blkid.  this knows more filesystems than yaird,
	  plus it knows that ext3 should be ext2 in initramfs.
	  to be examined.
	- for cryptsetup, do we need infinite loop around bad
	  password, or fall into a shell?
	- what do we need for internationalization?
	- Fedora 4 no longer ships ash; need an alternative
	- support loopback devices as root
	- dmraid - manage software raid controllers.
	- kernel command line processing: root=,
	- support multipath
	- ext2 migration, still necessary?
	- software suspend support
	- add Fedora spec file?
