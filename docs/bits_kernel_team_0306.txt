Hi,

Half-way between the sarge release and the etch freeze the Debian kernel
team takes a look back at what already happened after the sarge release
and what you should expect for etch.

linux-2.6
~~~~~~~~~
The common source package linux-2.6 builds the various kernel images and
headers. All archs are supported with the current exception of
mips/mipsel. The shift to an unified package since the linux-2.6.12
release allows to ride latest upstream. We expect more easier security
builds for the etch time frame too.

Latest upstream reaches unstable almost the day of it's release.
Experimental acts as staging area, where the -rcX kernels are build.  If
you want to be on the sliding edge Bastian Blank provides daily builds out
of the debian-kernel repository [1]. The most user visible change is the
renaming of kernel-image-2.6-$flavour into linux-image-2.6-$flavour. The
old version being left as transitioning package for upgrades from sarge.

There is lots of excitement around the x86 SMP alternatives patch, which
would allow to reduce the current number of flavors. SMP hardware would
just be an special case of hotplug CPU's. The uniprocessor flavors would
also support SMP and the SMP ones could be dropped. On the feature side
there is work going on to add vserver, xen and uml flavors to linux-2.6.
Most legacy patches Debian specific patches have been cleared, the bulk of
the current patchset is arch specific. 2.6 arch support is growing from
release to release, so those patchsets should be no concern. 

2.6 Linux features initramfs, which are gzipped cpio archives. They allow
to take over early boot. The handoff occures much earlier than with initrd
and ramfs is more memory efficient than older ramdisk.  Currently there
are two different supported tools for generating the initramfs:
initramfs-tools and yaird. initramfs-tools allowing a more generic boot
image by design and thus is the default. See for details [2].

bug reporting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Since kernels still fix more bugs then they create we encourage testing of
latest -rcX kernels in experimental. If the bug you are seeing is fixed in
latest -rcX then there is no need to open a bug report against previous
2.6.  We will rebase linux-2.6 on the next upstream release. If your bug
is reproducible in latest -rcX use reportbug and don't forget to add the
relevant details like latest known good (full dmesg, lspci, ..). This
allows upstream to be made aware of regressions.

If you have an old open bug against earlier 2.6 revision please test
against latest and feedback your findings.

security
~~~~~~~~
Dann Frazier and Simon Horman are doing a marvelous job in scanning,
testing all CVE's, which get issued against the Linux kernel.  The next
round of the sarge Debian kernel are prepared - testing is highly welcome
[3]. You won't believe it but there is even a round for woody [4].

End of line
~~~~~~~~~~~
linux-2.4 is officially deprecated. After having several releases where
your Linux kernel choice was as wide stretching between 2.2 - 2.6 it is
finally time to concentrate on 2.6 only. Currently Horms does a bulk of 
linux-2.4 upstream security support and testing against latest CVE's.
Almost no other vendor provides 2.4 security support and it is
unreasonable to even think about that burden in the etch time frame.

As of linux-2.6.12 the i386 flavor and support has been dropped.
The 386 flavor got renamed as 486. Sarge has no official 386 support,
although it should mostly work there.

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Debian Linux kernel handbook contains lots of information about the
Debian Linux Image and how the various parts are build [5]. You'll find
also very practical chapters like "Filing a bug against a kernel package".

Cheers,
