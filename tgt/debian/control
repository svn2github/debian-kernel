Description: Linux target framework user-space tools
 Linux target framework (tgt) aims to simplify various SCSI target
 driver (iSCSI, Fibre Channel, SRP, etc) creation and maintenance.
 .
 Tgt consists of kernel modules, user-space daemon, and user-space
 tools. Some target drivers uses all of them and some use only
 user-space daemon and tools (i.e. they completely runs in user space).
 .
 This package contains the user-space daemon and tools, a recent Linux
 kernel is required for the modules.
 .
 Currently, tgt supports three target drivers:
 .
 - IBM VIO server (ibmvstgt)
 - iSCSI
 - Xen vscsifront/back
 .
 Note that tgt is under active development. Don't play with important
 data.
