desc: Driver for RAID 1 over TCP/IP
longdesc:
 Drbd is a block device which is designed to build high availability clusters by
 providing a virtual shared device which keeps disks in nodes synchronised using
 TCP/IP. This simulates RAID 1 but avoiding the use of uncommon hardware (shared
 SCSI buses or Fibre Channel).
 It is currently limited to fail-over HA clusters.
