desc: ThinkPad hardware/firmware access through sysfs
 The tp_smapi kernel module exposes some features of the ThinkPad
 hardware/firmware via a sysfs interface. Currently, the main implemented
 functionality is control of battery charging and extended battery status. The
 underlying hardware interfaces are SMAPI and direct access to the embedded
 controller.
