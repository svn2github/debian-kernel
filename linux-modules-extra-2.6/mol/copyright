This package was debianized by Jens Schmalzing jensen@debian.org on
Thu, 19 Apr 2001 16:09:51 +0200.

Officially released versions were downloaded from
ftp://ftp.nada.kth.se/home/f95-sry/Public/mac-on-linux/ .

Snapshots of development versions were obtained from the anonymous
rsync tree at zorn.theophys.kth.se::mol, followed by `make libimport'.

Meanwhile, both of the above-mentioned locations have moved, to
http://www.maconlinux.org/downloads/ and rsync.penguinppc.org::mol,
respectively.

No activity on http://www.maconlinux.org/ since 2004. This package is now
built from "unofficial" sources downloaded from http://dev.gentoo.org/~josejx/
