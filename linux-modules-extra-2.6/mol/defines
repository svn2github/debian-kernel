desc: Mac-on-Linux emulator 
longdesc:
 Mac-on-Linux is basically an emulator capable of running
 MacOS on most Debian/PowerPC machines.  However, several
 things are not emulated -- in particular, the processor
 runs natively, which makes Mac-on-Linux very fast.  The
 main drawback is the need for special support code in the
 kernel.
