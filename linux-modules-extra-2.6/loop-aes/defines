desc: loop-AES encryption
longdesc:
 The loop-AES encryption modules provide support for symmetric-key encryption of
 block devices. They are typically used to encrypt disk partitions and swap
 space.
 .
 Supported ciphers are AES, Twofish and Blowfish in CBC mode with seeded MD5 IV.
 Compatibility options are provided to access encrypted devices using deprecated
 modes such as cryptoloop, kerneli and loop-AES v1/v2.
 .
 You will need to install the package loop-aes-utils to use the loop-AES
 encryption modules.
