desc: Driver for Lempel Ziv compression method (LZMA)
longdesc:
 LZMA is a compression algorithm, based on the famous Lempel Ziv compression
 method.
 .
 The main characteristics of the algorithm are very good compression, fast
 decompression, use of lot of RAM for compression and low usage of RAM for
 decompression.
 .
 LZMA provides high compression ratio and very fast decompression, so it is very
 suitable for embedded applications. For example, it can be used for ROM
 (firmware) compression.
