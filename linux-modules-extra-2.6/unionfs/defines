desc: Driver for a stackable unification filesystem
longdesc:
 The unionfs driver provides a unification filesystem. It allows to virtually
 merge the contents of several directories and/or stack them, so that apparent
 file changes in the unionfs end in file changes in only one of the source
 directories.
