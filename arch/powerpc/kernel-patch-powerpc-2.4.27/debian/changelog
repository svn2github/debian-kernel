kernel-patch-powerpc-2.4.27 (2.4.27-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release.
    The "Let's keep Branden happy" release :).
  * benh has not yet forward ported the 2.4 -benh tree, so this is still based
    on benh's 2.4.26 import.
  * Again, 2.4 kernels are deprecated on powerpc, please use 2.6.8-1 or later
    kernels.
  * Disabled rivafb driver, since it is broken in benh's tree and need to be
    forward ported. Benh doesn't seem inclined to do so, and i don't have the
    hardware. It is not a problem, since pmac/nvidia hardware should work all
    right with offb, and should run 2.6.8 kernels anyway.

kernel-patch-2.4.22-powerpc (2.4.22-7) unstable; urgency=low

kernel-patch-2.2.15-powerpc (20000422-2.2.16pre4-1) frozen unstable; urgency=medium

  * Release critical - Needed for the new kernel-source, again.
  * Use Cort's current tree again, 2.2.16pre4.  Work around the epoch
    problems this way, luckily.

kernel-patch-2.2.15-powerpc (20000422-2.2.15pre20-1) frozen unstable; urgency=medium

  * Use new version of kernel-source.  This is release critical, because the
    previous version does not build with the new kernel-source, and thus
    boot-floppies can not build!

kernel-patch-2.2.15-powerpc (20000422-2.2.15pre19-1) frozen unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version for boot-floppies.
  * Use kernel-source-2.2.15, which is actually pre19.  Reduces the diff by
    a miraculous amount.
  * All local debian patches merged into Cort's tree now.
  * Got a clue, renamed upstream patch to simply bitkeeper.diff.gz, and
    removed need to edit the patching scripts every version.

kernel-patch-2.2.14-powerpc (20000418-2.2.15pre17-1) frozen unstable; urgency=medium

  * First release into the archive.  Release Manager: this is needed
    in frozen for powerpc boot floppies.
  * Update the rules file for some more automation (complexifying the
    version number further).
  * Remove the miBoot support patch; miBoot can load compressed
    kernel images without going through coff now.
  * Remove debugging statements from the load_ramdisk (separate
    boot/root) patch.
  * Update from Cort's tree.
  * Conflict with other versions of kernel-patch-*-powerpc.
    kernel-patches/apply/0powerpc is in each one for a reason - there
    should never be more than one installed.

kernel-patch-2.2.14-powerpc (20000406) frozen unstable; urgency=medium

  * Now based on Cort's bitkeeper tree, available by rsync at
    hq.fsmlabs.com::linuxppc_2_2.
  * Add a small fix for controlfb, and experimental patches for separate
    boot/root disk support, and Ben's miBoot support patch.

kernel-patch-2.2.14-powerpc (20000206) frozen unstable; urgency=medium

  * New package, based on kernel-patch-2.2.13-netwinder.
  * Based on Benjamin Herrenschmidt <bh40@calva.net>'s rsync tree at
    linuxcare.com.au::linux-pmac-benh.
  * Include the configs in the distributed package.  Just to make bootprep's
    life less painful.
