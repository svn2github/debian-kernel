linux-patch-2.6.16-mips (2.6.16-0) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Initial mips/mipsel 2.6 kernel.
  * Remove the XXS1500 flavour since there's little interest in it.
  * Remove the LASAT flavour since these machines never went into
    production.
  * Enable PCI network modules on Cobalt.  Closes: #315895.
  * Drop backwards-compatibility back that listed the byteorder info in
    /proc/cpuinfo since packages had long enough to migrate.
