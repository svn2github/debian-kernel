Starting with version 2.6.8-4, kernel-image-2.6.*-amd64-2.6.* is built with 
gcc-3.4 on both amd64 and i386, requiring you to build third party kernel 
modules with CC=gcc-3.4. 

With a 64bit userland, make-kpkg invocation has to be as follows:

MAKEFLAGS="CC=gcc-3.4" make-kpkg ...

while on 32bit userland:

MAKEFLAGS="CC=gcc-3.4 -m64" make-kpkg ...


Secondly, the amd64-nocona flavour has been split in two:

em64t-p4 - uniprocessor kernel image for intel P4 based systems with one 
processor and HT disabled.

em64t-p4-smp - smp kernel image for Xeon based systems with 2 or more 
processors or uniprocessor P4 systems with HT enabled.
