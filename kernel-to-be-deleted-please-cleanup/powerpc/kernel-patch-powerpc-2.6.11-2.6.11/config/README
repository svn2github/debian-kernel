This directory contains only fragments of .config files.  Using any
single one of them as a .config file for your kernel will result in
a lot of questions being asked.  In order to assemble some of those
fragments into a valid .config file, run the command `make flavour'
where flavour is the flavour of a pre-packaged Debian kernel-image,
for example powerpc or power4-smp.
