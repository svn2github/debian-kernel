kernel-source-2.6.11 (2.6.11-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * The megaraid legacy driver is around only to support AMI megaraid 1 and 2.
    All the other controllers are supported (according to the code) by the
    new megaraid driver:
    - Add patch drivers-scsi-megaraid_spiltup.dpatch:
      . Split PCI ID's properly between the 2 drivers.
      . Allow compilation of both drivers at the same time.
      . Update Kconfig.megaraid to reflect the new changes in the help.
      . Rename a few things in the old megaraid driver to avoid possible
        conflicts with the new drivers (NOTE: there might be more that needs
        to be changed given that now the 2 modules can be loaded at the same
        time).
    Patch and changelog by Changes by Fabio M. Di Nitto and Chuck Short.
    Taken from Ubuntu's kernel
    Allows the new megaraid driver to be enabled without
    disabling the old megaraid driver.
    (closes: #303547) (Simon Horman)
  * Fixed FTBFS when using a powerpc biarch compiler, and specifying a command
    line CC override, which killed the -m64 arcgument needed for ppc64.
    (Sven Luther)
  * Added patch for IBM eServer i/pSeries Virtual SCSI Target Driver from
    Dave Boutcher <boutcher@us.ibm.com>, needed for ppc64 boxes with virtual
    partitions, Thanks to Cajus Pollmeier for providing it.
    (Sven Luther)
  * Clarify the description of the kernel-patch-debian package by saying its
    intent is to apply to Debian's kernel-source orig.tar.gz, instead of saying
    it won't apply to a pristine Linux tree.  (closes: #311941)

  * skb-reset-ip_summed.dpatch: resolve checksumming exploit in
    fragmented packet forwarding (Joshua Kwan)

  * un-apply 083-x86_64_switch_mm_context_race.dpatch, it breaks amd64 SMP
    systems. Thanks to Stephen Frost who helped fixing this.
    (Frederik Schüler)

  * sparc64-sb1500-clock-2.6.dpatch by David Miller: enable recognition 
    of the clock chip on SunBlade 1500, it won't boot otherwise.
    (Jurij Smakov).

  * 088-ibmvscsi_event_struct_use_after_free.dpatch
    The ibmvscsi driver has paths that free evt_struct, and then proceed to
    use it.  That's clearly a no-no in SMP/threaded contexts; once an evt_struct
    is free, something else may grab it.  So, this patch:
    	- moves the free_event_struct() to after usage of the evt_struct
    	- creates a single path for cleanup
    	- calls evt_struct->done during cleanup, which is something that
    	  should've been happening.
    (Andres Salomon)

  * 089-i386_acpi_backwards_ifdef.dpatch
    [I386] An ACPI related printk is wrapped in an #ifdef that should be an
    #ifndef.  Correct that (Andres Salomon). 
    
  * 090-alsa_midi_emulation_chorus_reverb_swap.dpatch
    [ALSA] seq_midi_emul.c had CHORUS_MODE and REVERB_MODE swapped in sysex().
    This patch fixes that (Andres Salomon).

  * 091-alsa_emu8000_load_fx_skip_header.patch
    [ALSA] emu8000's load_fx() loads a userspace blob, and should be skipping
    over the header (Andres Salomon).

  * 092-net_sched_police_locate_sanity_check_input.dpatch
    [NET] Some sanity checks are needed to ensure payloads are the same size
    as the structures they're being copied into.  AFAICT, there's no way for a
    malicious user to inject a payload in here (it looks like police_locate
    stuff is called during routing changes by root); however, I can't say that
    I'm too familiar w/ tcf stuff (Andres Salomon).

  * 093-e1000_eeprom_read_off_by_one.dpatch
    The e1000 driver's read_eeprom and write_eeprom functions allowed a bit to
    much data to be read/written; an extra word.  Fix that (Andres Salomon).

  * 094-scsi_device_set_state_missing_oldstate.dpatch
    [SCSI] scsi_device_set_state() might be setting a device offline, w/ an
    oldstate of BLOCK; that shouldn't be considered an error.  Add the missing
    state transition (Andres Salomon).

  * 095-jffs2_build_filesystem_memory_leak.dpatch
    [JFFS2] Fix memory leak in jffs2_build_filesystem(), if jffs2_scan_medium
    fails (Andres Salomon).

  * 096-mtd_formatblock_zero_before_assignment.dpatch
    [MTD] Inside NFTL_formatblock and INFTL_formatblock, the code was previously
    assigning values to instr, then zero'ing out the values.  Instead, move the
    assignment to after the memset (Andres Salomon).

  * 097-mtd_s3c2410_nand_inithw_calc_rate_fix.dpatch
    [MTD] s3c2410_nand_inithw() was pulling timing information from the wrong
    place, making the timing incorrect.  This patch makes it pull the info from
    the right place (Andres Salomon).

  * 098-jffs2_do_mount_fs_init_bad_count.dpatch
    [JFFS2] Initialize each eraseblock's bad_count to 0 in jffs2_do_mount_fs().
    Unitialized memory sure is fun, eh?  (Andres Salomon)

  * 099-jfs_commit_inode_commit_race.dpatch
    [JFS] Fix race in jfs_commit_inode(); before actually doing the commit,
    retest to ensure that the inode is both dirty and linked (Andres Salomon).

  * 101-ppc64_hugetlb_mm_free_pgd_unlock.dpatch
    [PPC64] In hugetlb_mm_free_pgd(), mm->page_table_lock is locked, but never
    unlocked in the event of an error.  This patch fixes that (Andres Salomon).

  * 102-cosa_sppp_channel_init_delay_attach.dpatch
    Fix buglet in cosa's sppp_channel_init(); do not call sppp_attach() until
    the netdev contains info that sppp_attach needs (Andres Salomon).

  * 104-wan_sdla_firmware_cap_sys_rawio_addition.dpatch
    [SECURITY] The SDLA driver only checked CAP_NET_ADMIN when doing firmware
    uploads.  This patch adds an additional check for CAP_SYS_RAWIO, as well
    (Andres Salomon).

  * 107-xfs_finish_reclaim_always_inode.dpatch
    [XFS] In xfs_finish_reclaim(), xfs_ireclaim() should always be called
    (unless there's some sort of locking problem) before returning
    (Andres Salomon).

  * 108-xfs_attrmulti_by_handle_limit_mem_alloc.dpatch
    [SECURITY] xfs_ioctl(XFS_IOC_ATTRMULTI_BY_HANDLE) calls
    xfs_attrmulti_by_handle, which allocates memory based on user input.  This
    patch adds a check for a max size of memory to alloc; otherwise, a user
    can potentially DoS the system by exhausting memory.  Not sure whether root
    is required to open the vnode device, but to be on the safe side...
    (Andres Salomon)

  * 109-binfmt_elf_loader_solar_designer_fixes.dpatch
    [SECURITY] Fix from Solar Designer; the binfmt_elf load routines are
    returning incorrect values, and are not strict enough in checking the
    number of program headers (Andres Salomon).

  * 110-load_module_arg_checking.dpatch
    If the parsing of module args failed, the module could still be loaded
    successfully.  Fix that (Andres Salomon).

  * 111-security_seclvl_kconfig_dep.dpatch
    Add a Kconfig dependency on CRYPTO for SECURITY_SECLVL (Andres Salomon).

  * 112-audit_receive_skb_double_negative_return_val.dpatch
    audit_receive_skb negates the err it receives from audit_receive_msg.  It
    shouldn't do that (Andres Salomon).

  * 114-netfilter_private_queues.dpatch
    [NETFILTER] Amongst netfilter users, skb frag queues were shared.  This
    could cause problems.  See
    http://oss.sgi.com/archives/netdev/2005-01/threads.html#01036 for more
    details (Andres Salomon).

  * 115-proc_file_read_nbytes_signedness_fix.dpatch

  * 118-i2c_sis5595_setup_pci_config_return_checks.dpatch
    [I2C] The i2c-sis5595 was forward ported from 2.4, but the calls to
    read the pci config registers were never updated for 2.6.  As such, they
    are incorrectly handling the results of the function calls
    (Andres Salomon).

    Fix an oopsable condition in Openpromfs's property_read() (Andres Salomon).

  * 121-cpufreq_resume_readd.dpatch
    [CPUFREQ] Somewhere around 2.6.6, a call to cpufreq_driver->resume() was
    accidentally dropped.  Readd it (Andres Salomon).

  * 122-cpufreq_resume_readd_2.dpatch
    [CPUFREQ] Fix a problem w/ 121-cpufreq_resume_readd.patch, where a return
    value was not being checked correctly (Andres Salomon).

  * 123-atm_get_addr_signedness_fix.dpatch
    [SECURITY] Fix atm_get_addr()'s usage of its size arg, by making it
    unsigned.  WDYBTGT3-3 on
    http://www.guninski.com/where_do_you_want_billg_to_go_today_3.html
    (Andres Salomon).

  * 125-netfilter_private_queues_2.dpatch
    [SECURITY] Add missing bits needed to make 114-netfilter_private_queues.patch
    compile.  Patch stolen from ubuntu (mainly to keep the same ABI)
    (Andres Salomon).

  * 126-ftdi_sio_set_serial_info_baud_base_check.dpatch
    [USB] Change ftdi_sio's set_serial_info() to do a correct check for baud_base;
    it should be checking if baud_base<9600 if the baud_base has changed
    (Andres Salomon).

  * 129-video_cg3_screen_blanking.dpatch
    [SPARC] Fix cg3 blanking; the driver was setting _ENABLE_VIDEO on POWERDOWN,
    instead of unsetting it (Andres Salomon).

  * 130-sparc_prom_nodematch_check_getproperty.dpatch
    [SPARC] In prom_nodematch, check whether prom_getproperty() actually
    succeeds before using the string it sets (Andres Salomon).

  * 131-sparc_check_prom_getproperty.dpatch
    [SPARC] Check return value from prom_getproperty() in various places where
    it wasn't being checked (Andres Salomon).

  * 132-sparc32_get_tv32_use_correct_variable.dpatch
    [SPARC] get_tv32() uses a non-existent variable 'tv32'.  Fix that
    (Andres Salomon).

  * 133-scsi_advansys_build_with_non_pci.dpatch
    [SCSI] Allow advansys driver to compile if CONFIG_PCI isn't set
    (Andres Salomon).

  * 134-cciss_scsi_detect_put_host_on_error.dpatch
    [SCSI] cciss_scsi_detect() calls scsi_add_host(), which bumps the refcount
    (even in the event of an error).  Thus, if scsi_add_host fails, the
    scsi host refcount needs to be decremented; so, call scsi_host_put upon
    error (Andres Salomon).

  * 135-64bit_sys_shmget_compat_size_t_overflow.dpatch
    64bit archs that offer 32bit compat wrappers for sys_shmget were mostly
    passing the second arg as a 32bit signed int; what would happen then is,
    it would be casted to a size_t (64bit unsigned), and the sign would cause
    it to overflow.  Instead, we need to cast to a 32bit unsigned value first,
    and then cast to 64bit unsigned (Andres Salomon).

  * 136-64bit_sys_compat_overflows.dpatch
    More of the same as 135*.dpatch, except for stuff like sys_ipc, sys_semget,
    sys_msgsnd, etc (Andres Salomon).

  * 137-ppc64_prom_initialize_tce_table_typo.dpatch
    [PPC64] prom_initialize_tce_table() refers to 'vbase', which doesn't
    actually exist; instead, 'base' was what was meant (Andres Salomon).

  * 138-tulip_de_init_one_irq_init.dpatch
    The tulip driver's de_init_one() was using pdev->irq before it had been
    initialized.  Move its usage until after it has been initted
    (Andres Salomon).

  * 139-pci_dma_free_coherent.dpatch
    [I386] dma_free_coherent() was calling kmalloc with its args reversed;
    clearly incorrect (Andres Salomon).

  * 140-s390_memset_arg_order_fixes.dpatch
    [S390] Fix various drivers that call memset() with args in the wrong order
    (Andres Salomon).

  * 141-pci_devices_dont_disable_dev_if_busy.dpatch
    For various pci devices, if pci_request_regions fails (because resources
    are already in use), don't disable the pci device (someone else is using it)
    (Andres Salomon).

  * 142-r8169_dev_alloc_skb_alignment_fix.dpatch
    The r8169 driver wasn't alloc'ing enough memory for skbs; the size should
    be padded by NET_IP_ALIGN (Andres Salomon).

  * 143-sysfs_write_file_signedness_problem.dpatch
    [SYSFS] sysfs_write_file assigns the result of fill_write_buffer (which is
    signed and returns negative upon error) to an unsigned int.  Clearly, bad
    and wrong.. (Andres Salomon)

  * 144-sys_epoll_wait_int_overflow.dpatch
    [SECURITY] sys_epoll_wait contains an integer overflow; see
    http://seclists.org/lists/fulldisclosure/2005/Mar/0293.html for additional
    details (Andres Salomon).

  * ipv4-fragment-queues.dpatch, ipv4-fragment-queues-2.dpatch:
    Drop netfilter frag queue stuff, as a) it's an ABI change,
    b) it's fixed in 2.6.11, and c) it's not that critical.  It's more
    important to get other 2.6.10 fixes out to people (Andres Salomon).

  * 053-ipmi_unhandled_message_counting.dpatch
    This fixes some IPMI issues:
      - fix counting of handled and unhandled messages
      - decode_dmi should've been handling 16 byte boundaries instead of
        16 bit boundaries (Andres Salomon)

  * 054-ext3_journal_abort_before_panic.dpatch
    When an error occurs in ext3, if we're going to panic, do it *after*
    aborting the journal. (Andres Salomon)

  * [UML] 055-uml_new_thread_race.dpatch
    When creating a new thread, fix potential signal race that could
    cause stack corruption. (Andres Salomon)

  * [X86-64] 056-x86_64_acpi_do_suspend_lowlevel_arg.dpatch
    ACPI's do_suspend_lowlevel for x86_64 was never updated to no
    longer take an argument.  This patch removes the test checking the
    (non-existent) arg. (Andres Salomon)

  * [IA64] 058-ia64_binfmt_elf_bug_out.dpatch
    Returning early from ia64_elf32_init in the case of failures
    could be problematic.  Instead of doing that, call BUG(). (Andres Salomon)

  * [ALSA] 060-alsa_cs4231_lib_ifdef_typo.dpatch
    cs4231_lib.c has an #ifdef typo; s/SNDRV_DEBUGq_MCE/SNDRV_DEBUG_MCE/.
    (Andres Salomon)
  
  * [ALSA] 061-alsa_es18xx_ifdef_typo.dpatch
    es18xx.c also has an ifdef typo; s/CONFIG_PNP_/CONFIG_PNP/.
    (Andres Salomon)

  * [ALSA] 062-alsa_sscape_user_copy_check.dpatch
    The sscape driver does a __copy_to_user without actually checking to
    see whether it succeeds.  This patch makes it check the result.
    (Andres Salomon)

  * [ALSA] 063-alsa_opl4_build_fix.dpatch
    Build snd-opl3-lib when SND_OPL4_LIB is enabled. (Andres Salomon)

  * [ALSA] 064-alsa_usbaudio_disconnect.dpatch
    Return -EBADFD when a usbaudio device is disconnected. (Andres Salomon)

  * [ALSA] 065-alsa_vx_kcalloc.dpatch
    The vx driver allocates enough size for a pointer, when it should
    be allocating enough size for a struct vx_core_t. (Andres Salomon)

  * 066-ibmvscsi_probe_delay_loop_fix.dpatch
    The ibmvscsi driver's probe function could potentially exit the delay loop
    before the adapter has finished initializing (hostdata->request_limit == 0),
    and thus end up not scanning for drives. (Andres Salomon)

  * 067-scsi_gdth_pci_map_sg.dpatch
    In gdth driver, drop DMA/page mapping from gdth_copy_internal_data(); it's
    unnecessary, and buggy. (Andres Salomon)

  * 068-scsi_sd_read_capacity_LBD_bail.dpatch
    For scsi disks, if the disk capacity is too large for what's configured
    in the kernel, don't even attempt to use the disk. (Andres Salomon)

  * [ALSA] 069-alsa_sscape_upload_firmware_len.dpatch
    This patch does two things; the first is a cleanup of calls to
    verify_area (replaced w/ access_oks) in the sscape driver that I was
    too lazy to strip out; the second is a fixup of the length handling
    of firmware in upload_dma_data.  If __copy_from_user fails to copy data,
    the number of failed bytes wasn't kept track of. (Andres Salomon)

  * [ALSA] 070-alsa_rme9652_hdsp_get_autosync.dpatch
    rme9652's snd_hdsp_get_autosync_ref() should be getting the value
    of hdsp_autosync_ref, not hdsp_pref_sync_ref. (Andres Salomon)

  * [ALSA] 071-alsa_creation_order_fixes.dpatch
    This fixes the creation order for a bunch of sound drivers.  Some
    drivers were creating /proc entries and registering callback functions that
    required driver structs that had not yet been initialized.
    (Andres Salomon)

  * 072-sctp_do_bind_random_port.dpatch
    Fix bug within sctp_do_bind(); for ephemeral ports, set bp->port earlier,       so that addr actually gets the correct port (inside sctp_add_bind_addr).
    (Andres Salomon)

  * [USB] 073-usb_gadget_serial_free_ports.dpatch
    Inside gs_free_ports: don't deref memory that's already been freed.
    (Andres Salomon)

  * [USB] 074-usb_makefile_fixes.dpatch
    Update makefile for sl811(-hcd) and dc2xx drivers. (Andres Salomon)
  
  * 075-acpiphp_ibm_module_parm_perm.dpatch

  * [EXT3] 077-ext3_journal_abort_handle_silence.dpatch
    For aborted transaction, only spew errors the first time to avoid
    a flood of errors. (Andres Salomon)

  * [JBD] 078-jbd_journal_revoke_graceful_double_delete.dpatch
    journal_revoke may try to delete a metadata block twice; this patch
    allows a graceful recovery, instead of a BUG(). (Andres Salomon)

  * [I386] 079-i386_timer_resume_slowdown.dpatch
    After resume, make time run at normal speed.  Thanks to
    Daniel Drake <dsd@gentoo.org> for pointing this one out. (Andres Salomon)

  * 080-kernel_sched_might_sleep_ignore_if_oopsed.dpatch

  * [IA64] 081-ia64_early_sn_setup_nested_loop.dpatch
    early_sn_setup has a nested loop that uses the same loop variable
    as the outer loop.  This patch fixes that. (Andres Salomon)

  * [IDE] 082-ide_it8172_init_return_failure.dpatch
    it8172_init_one returns 1 instead of -ENODEV in probe function.  The
    pci subsystem considers that to be a success, when it should be a failure.
    (Andres Salomon)

  * [X86-64] 083-x86_64_switch_mm_context_race.dpatch
    Fix race in x86-64 SMP TLB handling, when context switching.

  * [I386] 086-i386_cpufreq_powernow_k8_acpi_error.dpatch
    If powernowk8_cpu_init() has a problem after it has initted acpi
    stuff, make sure to call the appropriate acpi exit routines before
    returning. (Andres Salomon)

  * [EXT3] 087-ext3_graceful_corruption_fixes.dpatch
    This patch makes ext3 handle instances of corruption more gracefully.
    It also changes __ext3_journal_forget (which 078-jbd_journal_revoke*.dpatch
    needs). (Andres Salomon)

    that actually works.  Thanks to S?ren Hansen <sh@warma.dk> for finding
    and submitting it. (Christoph Hellwig) (closes: #283241).

  * Rework the modular ide patch:
     - dropped support for unloading modules that didn't find devices
     - splited the rest into two patches, one that fixes modular ide
       support and one that fixes __init vs __devinit problems.
    (Christoph Hellwig).

  * Drop alsa-module-load-fix.dpatch, the issue has been fixed in a better
    way upstream. (Christoph Hellwig).

  * Drop drivers-input-psaux-hacks.dpatch, the patch has effictively disabled
    by every architecture setting INPUT_MOUSEDEV_PSAUX_ENABLE to 'y' already.

  * [alpha] Added a workaround for ext3 oops. (Norbert Tretkowski)

  * Fixes emu10k1_fx8010_code_t structure using indirect pointers to be less
    than 8192 bytes to follow the ioctl semantics and thus not break powerpc
    builds. Userland ioctl value is still changed. (Sven Luther and Fabbione)

  * Fix modular-vesafb.dpatch to not break the non-modular case
    (Christoph Hellwig) (closes: #289610).

  * Fix weird alpha IO failures due to typo. (Maximilian Attems)

  * [SECURITY] 033-rlimit_memlock_check.dpatch
    RLIMIT_MEMLOCK isn't checked properly, allowing for a DoS attack.
    See http://seclists.org/lists/fulldisclosure/2005/Jan/0270.html for
    more details.  This patch fixes it, and all reorganizes the stack resize
    stuff a bit (*sigh*) (Andres Salomon).

  * [SECURITY] 034-stack_resize_exploit.dpatch
    Fix exploitable race condition on SMP and HT systems where two
    threads attempt to expand the stack at the same time.  This is
    CAN-2005-0001 (happy new year!) (Andres Salomon).

  * [SECURITY] 035-do_brk_security_fixes-2.dpatch
    Further do_brk fixes; just to be safe, lock everywhere do_brk

  * 038-ftdi_sio_debug_output.dpatch
    Make ftdi_sio driver output debug message instead of error if attempting
    to write 0 bytes (Andres Salomon).

    Don't assume a port has a tty associated w/ it when resuming

    Incorrect register values are used inside __psycho_check_one_stc if
    PBM type is B (Andres Salomon).

    Fix locking issue inside ipip6_tunnel_link() (Andres Salomon).

  * 047-do_tcp_sendpages_tso_assertion.dpatch
    do_tcp_sendpages() didn't track skb->truesize correctly; this causes
    partially ACK'd TSO frames to potentially corrupt stuff as
    skb->truesize is too small (Andres Salomon).
  
  * 048-matroxfb_mtrr_ifdef.dpatch
    The mtrr stuff in the matroxfb driver needs to be wrapped w/ CONFIG_MTRR
    ifdefs (Andres Salomon).

  * 050-cfq_requeue_request_accounting.dpatch
    cfq_requeue_request can potentially decrement a counter past 0; we want
    to only decrement it if it's > 0 (Andres Salomon).

  * Updated patches to apply against 2.6.10 (Christoph Hellwig):
    . powerpc-g4-l2-flush-errata.dpatch

  * Dropped scsi-blacklist.dpatch, usb-storage updates make it unnessecarry
    (Christoph Hellwig).

  * Dropped ipsec-missing_wakeup.dpatch, crude hack that doesn't help a lot.

  * Added Al Viro's patch which fixes mxser.c compile on alpha and powerpc
    (Norbert Tretkowski).

  * 001-acpi_ibm_exit.dpatch
    Make acpi_ibm_exit() not marked as __exit; it is called by __init

    Properly handle PIO errors (Andres Salomon).

  * 003-libata_alpha_build_fix.dpatch

    (Andres Salomon).

  * 006-zatm_cast_fix_fix.dpatch
    Fix a silly gcc4 "fix"; in an attempt to drop an lvalue cast,
    the wrong variable was assigned to (leaking memory, clobbering
    the variable, etc) (Andres Salomon).

  * 007-pci_ide_no_reserve.dpatch
    Make generic_init_one return proper error values, instead of
    true/false.  This was causing pci devices to be reserved when
    they shouldn't have been (Andres Salomon).

    (Andres Salomon)

  * 015-vmscan_total_scanned.dpatch
    Keep total_scanned up to date in try_to_free_pages; not doing so
    was breaking some kswapd stuff (Andres Salomon).

  * 016-cs461x_gameport.dpatch
    Fix Makefile to actually build cs461x.o (Andres Salomon).

  * 017-conntrack_sctp_sysctl.dpatch

    registration fails in ip_conntrack_proto_sctp (Andres Salomon).

  * 018-ipt_recent_proc_remove.dpatch
    ipt_recent's init stuff wasn't properly cleaning up /proc entries

    ip_conntrack doesn't handle RST packets correctly (Andres Salomon).

    data in there (Andres Salomon).

    just asking for trouble (Andres Salomon).

    Flush pages when shifting them (Andres Salomon).

  * 023-nfs_dentry_refcount.dpatch

  * 024-nfs_incorrect_df_output.dpatch
    NFS mounts were apparently causing 'df' to display incorrect
    information (Andres Salomon).

  * 025-track_dummy_capability.dpatch
    [SECURITY] The dummy capabilities module wasn't keeping track of
    processes capabilities; so, when a capabilities module was loaded,
    all untracked processes would magically be given full capabilities.
    Here's the skinny:
    http://www.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/securityfocus/bugtraq/2004-12/0390.html
    (Andres Salomon).

  * 026-nfs_o_direct_error.dpatch
    In case of failure, nfs_get_user_pages should set pages to NULL
    (Andres Salomon).

  * 027-track_dummy_capability-2.dpatch
    Fix patch 025-track_dummy_capability.dpatch (Andres Salomon).

kernel-source-2.6.7 (2.6.7-4) unstable; urgency=high

  * Migrated pegasos patch from the powerpc package, as it will be accepted
    upstream (Sven Luther).

  * Added a errata fix for some recent G4 processors (Sven Luther).

  * Fixed the Powerpc/Pegasos marvell discovery II builtin gigabit ethernet

kernel-source-2.6.7 (2.6.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed another tainted driver (closes: Bug#242895), and amended
    remove-references-to-removed-drivers.dpatch accordingly.  Actually,
    this was done in the previous revision, but we forgot the changelog
    entry (Christoph Hellwig, Jens Schmalzing).

  * Renamed debian/revision back to version.Debian.  Having it outside the
    debian/ directory is mandatory for kernel-tree to work (Jens Schmalzing).

  * Added the drivers-net-tg3 patch.  It only adds firmware loading
    support, contrary to the drivers-net-tg3-readd patch which re-adds the
    whole driver.  As a consequence, the Debian patch also applies to the
    vanilla kernel again.  Note that this patch is only kept here for
    reference for the time being and will not be activated until the next
    upstream release (Jens Schmalzing).

  * Added the fs-asfs patch by Marek Szyprowski, containing support for
    the Amiga Smart Filesystem.  Actually, the patch was already part of
    the kernel-patch-powerpc package and has been moved over from there
    (Jens Schmalzing).

kernel-source-2.6.7 (2.6.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

  * Added split patches in dpatch format (Christoph Hellwig and Sven Luther).

  * Lots of patches merged upstream:
    . acpi-link
    . console-refcounting
    . doc-sound
    . drivers-hotplug-acpi-unregister
    . drivers-i810-update
    . drivers-ide-CONFIG_IDE_STROKE-at-runtime (slight changes, allows drops
      the config option completely)
    . drivers-mca_53c9x-needs_mca_legacy
    . drivers-mtd-sharp-missing-includes
    . drivers-mtd-uclinux-rootfs
    . drivers-neomagic-ids
    . drivers-neomagic-oss-ids
    . drivers-paride-epat (with minor updates)
    . drivers-pnp-needs-x86
    . drivers-scsi-aic7xxx-fixes (slightly different)
    . drivers-usb-storage-new-sony-device
    . drivers-video-tgafb-needs-selection.h
    . drivers-watchdog-missing-includes
    . fs-isofs-remove-unused
    . include-linux-mca.h-fixups (only partially)
    . makefile-wc-fixup
    . sparc64-NR_CPUS
    . x86-dma-mapping.h-fixups

  * Dropped some patches (Christoph Hellwig):
    . alpha_cia_window - incorrect (closes: #253787)
    . doc-initrd_devfs - incorrect, devfs names for initrd are okay
    . drivers-mwave_paper_over_sysfs_crap - buggy driver model integration
      removed completely upstream
    . drivers-net-ns83820-needs-FW_LOADER - incorrect, ns83820 doesn't
      load firmware at all
    . drivers-scsi-3w-xxxx-no_unregister - incorrect
    . export-proc_get_inode - the symbol is internal for a reason.  buggy
      drivers using it removed in 2.6.7
    . fs-msdos-dontbug - rejected upstream
    . fs-umsdosfs-crapola - umdos is disconnected from the build in 2.6
    . ppc-higher-binutils-requirement - upstream disagrees, Debian uses
      dpkg build depencies anyway
    . 00_doc-README.Debian - now handled differently by the packaging
  
  * Renamed version.Debian to debian/revision, in order to have all Debian
    specific bits in the debian directory (Jens Schmalzing).

  * Added the prune target to debian/rules.  It unpacks the vanilla
    kernel, removes the tainted bits, and creates a free .orig.tar.gz
    (Jens Schmalzing).

  * Added the monolith target to debian/rules.  It saves a copy of the
    original kernel tree, then for each revision applies the split patches
    via dpatch and creates a monolithic patch (Jens Schmalzing).

  * Add fs-jfs-compile to fix JFS compilation (Christoph Hellwig).

  * Package the upstream changelog file, taken from ChangeLog-<release>,
    into kernel-tree.  The rationale of this being that we should
    distribute the upstream changelog in the usual location, but it is
    enough to do this once (Jens Schmalzing).
