Description: Linux kernel image for version 2.4.29 on 386
 This package contains the Linux kernel image for version 2.4.29 on
 386,
 the corresponding System.map file, and the modules built by the packager.
 It also contains scripts that try to ensure that the system is not left in
 a unbootable state after an update.
 .
 If you wish to update a bootdisk, or to use a bootloader to make
 installing and using the image easier, we suggest you install the latest
 fdutils (for formatting a floppy to be used as boot disk), and LILO, for a
 powerful bootloader. Of course, both these are optional.
 .
 Kernel image packages are generally produced using kernel-package,
 and it is suggested that you install that package if you wish to
 create a custom kernel from the sources.
