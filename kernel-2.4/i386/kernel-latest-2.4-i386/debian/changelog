kernel-latest-2.4-i386 (100) unstable; urgency=low

  * Created this package for meta packages that had
    previously been provided by kernel-image-2.4.XX-i386
    - This is to allow kernel-image packages for multiple
      upstream kernel versions to co-exist.
    - Initial version is 100, as previous versions of
      the meta packages are already in the archive.
