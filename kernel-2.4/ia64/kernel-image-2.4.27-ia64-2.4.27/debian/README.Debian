Release Notes
-------------
- lib/xor.o cannot be compiled as a module.  depmod complains because its
  built with -mconstant-gp.  This is because xor.S is an assembly file, and
  the build system happens to always build assembly objects w/ -mconstant-gp.
  End result being that raid5.o also has to be statically linked.
