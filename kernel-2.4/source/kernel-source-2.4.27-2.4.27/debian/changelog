  * control
    Add build dependancy on gcc-3.3 (closes: #324591)

  * There was a bit of a screw up in 2.4.27-11 (by me)
    as 183_zisofs.diff was actually a copy of 182_linux-zlib-fixes.diff,
    and due to a quirk in the apply scripts, basically caused
    the zlib 182_linux-zlib-fixes.diff fixes to be reversed,
    and thus neither patch was applied. 186_linux-zlib-fixes-2.diff
    and 187_zisofs-2.diff resolve this problem. More information below.

kernel-source-2.4.27 (2.4.27-5) unstable; urgency=high

  * Fix a goofup in debian/apply that didn't really affect normal users.
  * 070_ide_scan_pcibus.diff: Add this very crucial hunk of code that was
    missed while exploding the monolithic patchset into small diffs.
  * 071_dep_fw_loader-2.diff: Simplify 066_dep_fw_loader.diff (removed) so
    that it works with make xconfig as well. (Closes: #268436)
  * Remove obsoleted README.NMU.

    them up) so that we can run the debian/apply script on a real pristine
    source tree. (Closes: #269412)
  * Remove Documentation/man in clean target, make-kpkg kernel-doc leaves it
    lying around.

    enabled if FW_LOADER is not selected. (Closes: #266397)
  * 067_tg3_ampersand.diff: Remove spurious & to tp->pdev, which caused a

kernel-source-2.4.27 (2.4.27-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Urgency high to enter sarge. NEW processing was quick, thanks Randall!
  * Bah. Remove .patch-stamps support from debian/apply as it prevents the
    user from being able to unapply kernel-patch-debian-2.4.27 on an
    unpacked kernel-source.tar.bz2.
  * debian/patches/series/2.4.27-2: file with only a newline in it (so
    it doesn't get reaped by make-kpkg clean for being size 0.)
  * Use --no-backup-if-mismatch in debian/apply.

kernel-source-2.4.27 (2.4.27-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

  * Bugs fixed (will shortly be fixed in 2.4.26 as well, and closed there):
        - #264202: doesn't build with CONFIG_ACPI_ASUS enabled
        - #255406: Kernel crash when removing interface from wrong bridge
          group
        - #262870: device-mapper patch screwed up; prevents application of
          evms patches (see below)

  * CVE issues fixed by this release:
        - CAN-2004-0495 (Al Viro sparse fixes)
        - CAN-2004-0497 (users could modify group ID of arbitrary files on
          the system)
        - CAN-2004-0535 (e1000 minor info leak)
        - CAN-2004-0685 (backported Conectiva usb sparse fixes)
        - CAN-2004-0415 (file offset pointer handling race)
        - CAN-2004-0565 (information leak ia64)

  * Split out all of the monolithic patches into feature-divided patches.
    Change apply/unpatch scripts to use this new system, using metadata to
    describe which patches are added or removed in a given release.

    However, apply script retains the same features on the outside as the
    old one (i.e. incremental updates to old kernel-source trees of the same
    upstream version.)

  * Update the DM patch from kernel-patch-device-mapper.

  * Apply IPsec update, thanks Horms.

  * Merge patches from kernel-image-sparc-2.4 in.

  * Run prune-non-free. This removes tg3.c, but 063_firmwareless_tg3.diff
    adds the firmware-unencumbered one.

  * Fix build dependencies:
        - Everything becomes Build-Depends-Indep: this package produces
          no arch-dependent packages.
        - libc-dev -> libc6-dev | libc-dev.
        - libncurses-dev | ncurses-dev -> libncurses5-dev | libncurses-dev.
        - debian/compat is 3, so add a versioned B-D-I on debhelper (>= 3).

kernel-source-2.4.26 (2.4.26-5) unstable; urgency=high

  * Cleaned up after the previous upload.  In particular, patch-2.4.26-3
    is now part of the kernel-source tarball again.  Urgency set to high
    since this patch fixes a couple of security issues.

  * Added a conflict to kernel-tree to make sure that unsuspecting package
    builders (both human and non-human) do not use the previous upload of
    kernel-source for their kernel-image packages.

  * Added an almost empty patch to handle the revision bump.
