Notes for building the patch packages
-------------------------------------

 - Be sure to delete the include/asm symlink before attempting to make a
   large kernel diff!  Otherwise patch behaves very badly...
 - debian/rules now gets everything it needs from debian/changelog,
   but control has a way to go.
