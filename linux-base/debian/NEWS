  * Some HP Smart Array controllers are now handled by the new 'hpsa'
    driver, rather than the 'cciss' driver.

    While the cciss driver presented disk device names beginning with
    'cciss/', hpsa makes disk arrays appear as ordinary SCSI disks and
    presents device names beginning with 'sd'.  In a system that already
    has other SCSI or SCSI-like devices, names may change unpredictably.

    During the upgrade from earlier versions, you will be prompted to
    update configuration files which refer to device names that may
    change.  You can choose to do this yourself or to follow an automatic
    upgrade process.  All changed configuration files are backed up with
    a suffix of '.old' (or '^old' in one case).
