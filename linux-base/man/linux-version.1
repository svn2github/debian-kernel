.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBlinux\-version\fR operates on Linux kernel version strings as
reported by \fBuname -r\fR and used in file and directory names.
These version strings do not follow the same rules as Debian package
version strings and should not be compared as such or as arbitrary
strings.
.TP
.BI compare \ VERSION1\ OP\ VERSION2
Compare version strings, where \fIOP\fP is a binary
operator. \fBlinux\-version\fP returns success (zero result) if the
specified condition is satisfied, and failure (nonzero result)
otherwise.  The valid operators are: \fBlt le eq ne ge gt\fP
.TP
\fBsort\fR [\fB\-\-reverse\fR] \fIVERSION1 VERSION2\fR ...
Sort the given version strings and print them in order from lowest to
highest.  If the \fB\-\-reverse\fR option is used, print them in order
from highest to lowest.
.TP
\fBlist\fR [\fB\-\-paths\fR]
List kernel versions installed in the customary location.  If the
\fB\-\-paths\fR option, show the corresponding path for each version.
