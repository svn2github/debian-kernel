linux-latest-2.6 (26) unstable; urgency=low

  * The old IDE (PATA) drivers are no longer developed.  Most PATA
    controllers can be handled by new drivers using 'libata', which is
    already used for SATA controllers.  The new kernel package, which
    this package depends on, enables all the new drivers that are
    considered stable and disables the old drivers that they replace.

    While the old drivers presented device names beginning with 'hd',
    libata makes PATA drives appear as SCSI devices and presents device
    names beginning with 'sd' (hard drive), 'sr' (optical) or 'st' (tape).
    In a system that already has other SCSI or SCSI-like devices, names
    may change unpredictably.

    During the upgrade from earlier versions, you will be prompted to
    update configuration files which refer to device names that may
    change.  You can choose to do this yourself or to follow an automatic
    upgrade process.  Unfortunately the automatic upgrade process does not
    cover tape drives.  All changed configuration files are backed up with
    a suffix of '.old' (or '^old' in one case).

    The automatic upgrade code does not support the configuration files
    of many of the boot loaders used on non-PC architectures, so you may
    be prompted to make changes manually.
