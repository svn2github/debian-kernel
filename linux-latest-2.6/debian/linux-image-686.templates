Type: error
_Description: This system requires a different kernel configuration
 Debian's '686' kernel configuration has been replaced by the '686-pae'
 configuration, which uses PAE (Physical Address Extension).  However,
 the CPU in this system does not support PAE.
 .
 You should install linux-image-486 and remove linux-image-686 and/or
 linux-image-2.6-686 if they are currently installed.
