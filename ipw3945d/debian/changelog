ipw3945d (1.7.22-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Create the PID directory when starting, if it does not exist.
    This may happen if user have chosen to put /var/run on tmpfs.
    Thanks to Luca Capello. Closes: #408928

ipw3945d (1.7.22-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add a workaround to prevent the daemon from being started
    twice. That may happen when it is started before the /var/run
    directory is cleaned up, so the pid file is lost. Now we
    check for such conditions and stop the daemon first, if it
    is running without a proper pid file. Thanks to Dieter Roels
    for help with debugging and testing. Closes: #401558
  * Increase the delay after start from one to three seconds to
    finally get rid of all the timing issues (ifup would still
    fail occasionally with one second delay).

ipw3945d (1.7.22-2) unstable; urgency=low
  
  * Following the suggestion by Malte Schirmacher, add one second
    delay after starting the daemon to make sure that it's fully up
    and running before an attempt to bring up an interface is made.
    Closes: #399607
