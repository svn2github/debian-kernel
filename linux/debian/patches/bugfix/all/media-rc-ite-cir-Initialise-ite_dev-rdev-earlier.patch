Subject: [media] rc: ite-cir: Initialise ite_dev::rdev earlier
Bug-Debian: http://bugs.debian.org/684441

ite_dev::rdev is currently initialised in ite_probe() after
rc_register_device() returns.  If a newly registered device is opened
quickly enough, we may enable interrupts and try to use ite_dev::rdev
before it has been initialised.  Move it up to the earliest point we
can, right after calling rc_allocate_device().
