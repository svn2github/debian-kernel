Description: global file system kernel module
 The Global File System 2 allows a cluster of machines to concurrently access
 shared storage hardware like SANs or iSCSI and network block devices. GFS
 can be deployed to build high available services without the single point
 of failure a file server would be.
 .
 This package contains the compiled gfs and gnbd kernel modules for _KVERS_
 .
 If you compiled a custom kernel, you will most likely need to compile a
 custom version of this module as well. The redhat-cluster-source
 package has been provided for this purpose.
