Description: Red Hat cluster suite (meta package)
 The only scope for this package is to install the full Red Hat Cluster Suite
 in one shot. It is safe to remove it.

Description: cluster manager
 CMAN is a symmetric general-purpose cluster manager. It consists of
 a connection manager that handles cluster membership management,
 messaging among the cluster nodes, event notification, quorum and
 state transitions. Another part of CMAN is a service manager that
 handles service groups.
 .
 This package contains only userspace tools for controlling the actual
 cluster manager.

Package: libcman2
Section: libs
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: cluster manager - libraries
 cman provides a general purpose, openais based, cluster manager.
 .
 This package contains the client libraries.

Package: libcman-dev
Section: libdevel
Architecture: any
Depends: libcman2 (= ${binary:Version})
Description: cluster manager - development files
 cman provides a general purpose, openais based, cluster manager.
 .
 This package contains the files needed for developing applications.

Package: libdlm2
Section: libs
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: distributed lock manager - library
 DLM is a symmetric general-purpose distributed lock manager. It is
 used for example by GFS and the distributed volume manager.
 .
 This is the client library for applications using the lock manager.
 The lock manager itself is a kernel module.

Package: libdlm-dev
Section: libdevel
Architecture: any
Depends: libdlm2 (= ${binary:Version})
Description: distributed lock manager - development files
 DLM is a symmetric general-purpose distributed lock manager. It is
 used for example by GFS and the distributed volume manager.

Section: admin
Description: global file system tools 
 The Global File System allows a cluster of machines to concurrently access
 shared storage hardware like SANs or iSCSI and network block devices. GFS
 can be deployed to build high available services without the single point
 of failure a file server would be.
 .
 This package contains userspace tools for creating and managing global
 file systems. GFS itself is a set of kernel modules.
 .
 Note: the package requires gfs2-tools installed and it's known to work fine
 even if GFS2 is highly experimental and *MUST NOT* be used in production
 enviroment yet.

Description: global file system 2 tools (EXPERIMENTAL)
 The Global File System 2 allows a cluster of machines to concurrently access
 shared storage hardware like SANs or iSCSI and network block devices. GFS
 can be deployed to build high available services without the single point
 of failure a file server would be.
 .
 This package contains userspace tools for creating and managing global
 file systems. GFS2 itself is a set of kernel modules.
