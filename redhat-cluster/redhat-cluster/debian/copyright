This is the Ubuntu / Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the
RedHat Cluster Suite.

Mainly packaged by Fabio M. Di Nitto <fabbione@ubuntu.com>, a lot
of people have been contributing to this package in several different
areas/bits. In non-particular order:

- Frederik Shueler <fs@lowpingbastards.de>
  several patches and testing.
- Bastian Blank <waldi@debian.org>
  for all his packages, init scripts, build rules.
- Adam Conrad <adconrad@ubuntu.com>
  for some init script fixes and portability patches.
- A really great and responsive upstream.
