_Description: Really upgrade Cluster Manager?
 An older version of cman installed on the system.
 .
 The version that is going to be installed is *NOT* compatible with the old
 one and will break the cluster horribly if not upgraded properly.
 .
 Check https://wiki.debian.org/UpgradingClusterProcedure for the latest
 instructions on how to proceed.
 .
 Select OK if you wish to continue with the upgrade.
