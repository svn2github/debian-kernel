_Description: Cluster Manager Upgrade
 An older version of cman installed on the system.

 The version that is going to be installed is *NOT* compatible with the old
 one and will break the cluster horribly if not upgraded properly.

 Check https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UpgradingClusterProcedure for the latest
 instructions on how to proceed.
