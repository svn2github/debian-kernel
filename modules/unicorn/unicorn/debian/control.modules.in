Description: Bewan ADSL PCI st and USB modems drivers for Linux (kernel ${kpkg:Kernel-Version}).
 This package contains the set of loadable kernel modules for the
 Bewan ADSL PCI st and Bewan ADSL USB modems.
 .
 This package contains the compiled kernel modules for ${kpkg:Kernel-Version}
 The unicorn package contains applications that can be usefull to monitor the
 state of the Bewan ADSL modems.
 .
 If you have compiled your own kernel, you will most likely need to build
 your own unicorn-modules.  The unicorn-source package has been
 provided for use with the Debian kernel-package utility to produce a version
 of unicorn-module for your kernel.
 . 
 Note that this package is i386 only for now, but if people would want
 to use this modem on other arches, please tell me, and i will try to get
 the proprietary part built for this arch.
